    <h2><a name="Introduction"><font color=
    "#0000e0">Introduction</font></a></h2>

    <p>The <a href="ports.html">ports tree</a> is an huge piece of work that
    permits to OpenBSD users to use extra stuff without losing time in
    patching, configuring, etc. This work is made by a few volunteers who
    spend hours to make your favorite applications working fine on your
    system. Many people think that they can't help our project because they
    don't have enough knowledge, this is false because they can help porters
    to work better and faster.</p>

    <h2><a name="How"><font color="#0000e0">How</font></a></h2>

    <p>Simply by testing submitted updates or new ports which are posted on
    <a href="mailto:ports@openbsd.org">ports@openbsd.org</a>. By doing this
    you reduce the latency of commit and also increase the number of ports to
    be committed (many ports are not committed because of lack of testing
    !).</p>

    <h2><a name="First"><font color="#0000e0">First step</font></a></h2>

    <p>Before starting you must know that port development is done by
    following <a href="plus.html">OpenBSD-current</a>, you can find
    instructions on following current <a href="anoncvs.html">source</a> and
    <a href="faq/upgrade-minifaq.html">upgrade faq</a>. When it's done you
    are ready to follow <a href=
    "mailto:ports@openbsd.org">ports@openbsd.org</a> .</p>

    <h2><a name="Testing"><font color="#0000e0">Testing</font></a></h2>

    <p>Now that you are on the mailing-list you can find two type of submits
    : new ports and updates. New ports are generally posted as an attachment
    or an url to a tarball which contains the port tree. A good idea is to
    extract it into the <tt>/usr/ports/mystuff</tt> directory and then you
    can test it. Updates are generally a diff against current ports tree, so
    it is suggested to copy the port in mytstuff/ and apply the diff to
    prevent breaking your tree.</p>

    <p>You will need to perform step by step the building of the port to
    verify that every <a href=
    "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ports&amp;sektion=7&amp;format=html">
    target</a> is going right :</p>

    <ul>
      <li>fetch : you just need to verify that distfile(s) are correctly
      downloaded.</li>

      <li>extract : generally extract is done without problem, so you can
      ignore this target in most cases.</li>

      <li>patch : check if patches apply correctly and track down forgotten
      .orig .</li>

      <li>configure : for ports which use a configure script you can verify
      they have correct path for dependencies, use(less) features, etc
      ...</li>

      <li>build : the build itself should not give errors but could contain
      minor warnings about tmpnam issue to be resolved by using mkstemp.</li>

      <li>fake : this target is faking installation of the package to prepare
      for packaging. you should verify that files are installed in fake
      directory.</li>

      <li>package : package creation can break if pkg/PLIST* and/or
      pkg/PFRAG* are wrong.</li>

      <li>install : check that package install works fine.</li>

      <li>deinstall : don't forget to test deinstall.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You could also check some pkg/ stuff like DESCR, MESSAGE, INSTALL,
    DEINSTALL</p>

    <h2><a name="Commenting"><font color="#0000e0">Commenting</font></a></h2>

    <p>At the end of the test comes the really important thing : comments.
    Even if the port is working fine you must comment it, if we have ten
    posts where people say that the port runs fine under different arch then
    commit is done faster. If it does not work then you must give some
    information, you have tools for that like <a href=
    "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/infrastructure/build/portslogger">
    portslogger</a>.</p>

    <p>Example :<br>
    </p>

    <div style="margin-left: 2em">
      <table border="0" cellpadding="3" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
<pre>
    # make install | /usr/ports/infrastructure/build/portslogger
</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <br>
     <br>
     

    <p>This will catch the output into a log file located in the current
    directory.</p>

    <h2><a name="More"><font color="#0000e0">More testing</font></a></h2>

    <p>For those who are more skilled they can test targets like
    lib-depends-check, look at patches and pkg stuff. You can also provide
    diff to correct bugs or to add flavors, etc ...</p>
