<h2>OpenBSD/mac68k</h2>

<hr>

<p>
OpenBSD/mac68k runs on many of the m68k-based Macintosh machines.  It
requires a Motorola 68020, 68030, or a 68040 processor.  If you have a
68020, it will also need a Motorola 68851 PMMU (note that this is
different from the 68881, which is an FPU).  While the system is
quite useful (it's being run as an internet server and router), there
is still plenty of work to be done.  Please jump in and become a part
of the action!
</p>

<h3><strong>History and Status:</strong></h3>

<p>
The mac68k port of OpenBSD was derived from NetBSD/mac68k, and it
supports the same hardware as NetBSD-current.  This does not mean
that OpenBSD is the same as NetBSD.  Far from it.  The kernel makes
up only a small part of the full system.

<p>
There is a list of <a href="plus.html">changes</a> in the
machine-independent portions of the system.  Check it out.
