<h2>OpenBSD/mac68k</h2>

<hr>

<p>
OpenBSD/mac68k runs on many of the Motorola 680x0-based Macintosh machines.  It
requires a Motorola 68020, 68030, or a 68040 processor.  If you have a
68020, it will also need a Motorola 68851 PMMU (note that this is
different from the 68881, which is an FPU).  While the system is
quite useful (it's being run as an internet server and router), there
is still plenty of work to be done.  Please jump in and become a part
of the action!
</p>

<h3><font color=#0000e0><strong>History and Status:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
The mac68k port of OpenBSD was derived from NetBSD/mac68k, and it
supports the same hardware as NetBSD-current.  This does not mean
that OpenBSD is the same as NetBSD.  Far from it.  The kernel makes
up only a small part of the full system.
</p>

<p>
<h3><font color=#0000e0>Supported Hardware:</font></h3>
OpenBSD/mac68k now runs on most 680x0 Macintoshes.  Specifically, it
should work on:
<ul>
<li> 68020 with 68851 PMMU and 68881 FPU
<li> 68030 with 68882 FPU (most Macs have this)
<li> 68040 (not including the 68LC040)
</ul>
</p>

<p> 
The following Macintosh models are "fully" supported.  This means that at
least the SCSI controller, ADB (keyboard and mouse), and some sort of
display will function on these models.  On some of these machines, a PMMU
and/or FPU are required if they are not provided by default with the
machine.
<ul>
<li> Mac II, Mac IIx, Mac IIcx, Mac IIci, Mac SE/30,
<li> Mac IIsi, Mac IIvx, Mac IIvi, Performa 600, Centris 650,
<li> Color Classic, Classic II, LC520, LC550, Mac LCIII, Performa 4xx,
<li> LCII, LCIII, MacTV, Quadra 610, Quadra 650, Quadra 840, Quadra
<li> 840AV, Quadra 800, Quadra 700, Duo Series,
<li> Powerbook 180 and 180c, PB140, PB145, PB145B, PB160, PB170, PB165,
<li> PB165c
</ul>
</p>

<p>Supported devices on all of the above systems include:
<ul>
<li> Internal SCSI bus and most SCSI tapes, hard drives, and CD-ROMs
<li> Internal sound--enough to beep on some machines, anyway
<li> Most NuBus video cards (there have been some problems with some 24-bit color cards)
<li> Both internal serial ports
<li> ADB keyboards and mice
<li> Ethernet cards based on the Natl. Semiconductor 8390 (Asante, Apple, and a few others)
<li> Some ethernet cards based on the SONIC chip including internal Ethernet on many of Apple's Quadras.
</ul>

<p>
Some systems will boot and are usable from an external terminal (serial tty or SL/IP):
<ul>
<li> LC475, Performa 475, Quadra 605
<li> possibly others
</ul>
<p>

<p> 
What isn't supported, but often asked about:
<ul>
<li> PowerPC-based Macs.  Work will begin on this, sometime soon.  It will be separate from this port, though.  The PowerPC is a much different processor.
<li> Machines based on Apple's IOP technology including the Mac IIfx.
<li> Machines based on the 68LC040 processor.  Unfortunately, the chip itself contains a major bug which is presently being worked on.  However, machines such as the Centris 605 don't work right now.
</ul>

Current information and help with installing can be found in the
<a href="ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.2/mac68k/INSTALL.mac68k">
INSTALL.mac68k</a>
document distributed with the most recent release of OpenBSD.  Also, be sure
to see the most recent mac68k errata on the <a href="errata.html#mac68k">OpenBSD
errata page</a>.  It contains some information <em>vitally important</em> to
correctly installing the system from the CDROMs.
</p>

<p>
There is a list of <a href="plus.html">changes</a> in the
machine-independent portions of the system.  Check it out.
