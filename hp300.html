<h2>OpenBSD/hp300</h2>

<hr>
<h3><font color=#0000e0><strong>History and Status:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
OpenBSD follows in the footsteps of 4.4BSD by supporting the hp300; most
types of machine are supported with 68020 or better processors, along with
SCSI and HPIB storage devices.
</p>

<p>
OpenBSD/hp300 runs 8k pagesize executables natively (the first operating
system for the hp300 to do so), maintaining the standard binary format
used by all other OpenBSD m68k platforms.
</p>

<p>
The hp300 port has now also switched to the regular config(8) for kernel
configuration.  This enables the port to support things like
<i>User Kernel Config</i> and, in the future, the generic SCSI sub-system.

<br>(The first port is typically configured as a <i>dca</i> device.)
</ul>
<li>Network interfaces:
<ul>
<li>98643 built-in and add-on LAN cards.
</ul>
<li>Displays:
<ul>

<li>SCSI autochanger.
</ul>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<sup>(1)</sup> 400-series machines configured for <i>Domain/OS</i> are not fully
supported; the ROMs must be in <i>HP-UX mode</i> in order to boot the system.
See the <a href=hp300faq.html>hp300 FAQ page</a> for information on how to
change the ROM mode.
<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> SCSI-II drives are known to work, though this may require
changing a jumper on some drives.  See your disk's documentation for details.
<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> Serial mice connected to a <i>HIL to quad</i> converter are also
known to work.

<h3><font color=#0000e0><strong>Notably Unsupported Hardware:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>SGC bus on the 425e, and all associated frame buffers.
<li>310 and all other 68010 based systems.
</ul>

<h3><font color=#0000e0><strong>Compatibility Notes and Known Bugs:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
OpenBSD/hp300 is known to run old pre-1.2 NetBSD m68k4k binaries via the
<strong>COMPAT_M68K4K</strong>, <strong>COMPAT_10</strong> and
<strong>COMPAT_11</strong> kernel options; it is assumed that it will
also still run hp300 4.4BSD binaries.  <strong>COMPAT_SUNOS</strong> may be
used to run sun3 SunOS binaries (a few have been tested and work). 
<strong>COMPAT_HPUX</strong> is also available, but has not been tested.
</p>

<p>
Slower machines may sometimes have problems booting from
a serial console.  The symptom of this are panics during the kernel
autoconfiguration process; this can be avoided by using faster/different
terminals or by eliminating the terminal's use of flow control.
</p>

<p>
There is now (untested) support for the 425e; a terminal must be connected
to the first serial port in order to boot the system.  If anyone gets
a 425e to work, please let me know.
