<h2>OpenBSD/pmax</h2>

<hr>
<h3><strong>History and Status:</strong></h3>

<p>
It pmax port of OpenBSD is being worked on by Thomas Graichen (<a
href=mailto:graichen@openbsd.org>graichen@openbsd.org</a>). The status
is that i have it so far running now (a lot of thanks to Dieter Mayer
who made all this possible by sending me a Decstaion 5000/200 -
thanks) and i have also started to create snapshots of OpenBSD/pmax
and X11 for OpenBSD/pmax from time to
time - you may get them from 
<a href=ftp.html>the usual OpenBSD ftp servers</a>.
</p>

<h3><strong>Differences to NetBSD/pmax:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>we have native shared libraries
<li>the port is self-hosting (i.e. it only uses in-tree tools - there is
no need for externel binutils).
<li>i try too keep the release of snapshots and releases close to
releasing X11 binaries too (X11R5 servers and X11R6 clients - both
compiled with ProjectRoot /usr/X11R6)
<li>you get all the usual OpenBSD improvements, additions and fixes
</ul>

</p>
Aside from that the hardware support is nearly identical to NetBSD/pmax.
