These companies and organisations trust OpenBSD's rigorous code audit 
and security-first development model. They use the system to build firewalls, 
intrusion detection systems, or general purpose servers. University 
researchers and IT department developers often have similar 
security and stability requirements and choose OpenBSD.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.netsec.net/">Network Security Technologies, Inc.</a>,
a network and computer security firm, uses OpenBSD for high speed
intrusion detection, virtual private networking, and data
warehousing applications.  Network Security Technologies, Inc
is located in the Washington DC metro area, and uses OpenBSD at
several undisclosed military and government agency locations.<p>

<li>Software giant <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe Systems</A>
uses OpenBSD on a number of their network firewalls and network
testing systems.<p>

<li><A HREF="http://www.calyx.net">Calyx Internet Access Corp.</A> uses 
OpenBSD for running all mission-critical services including WWW, FTP and 
email as well as for network monitoring at its data centers in New York 
and Amsterdam.  Even larger web sites such as 
<A HREF="http://www.snapple.com">snapple.com</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.tanqueray.com">tanqueray.com</A> and others are no 
challenge for OpenBSD.<p>

<li><A HREF="http://www.alteon.com">Alteon Networks</A> the gigabit ethernet
hardware manufacturer, uses OpenBSD machines in varying capacities ranging
from testbeds to gateways.<p>

<li><A HREF="http://www.core-sdi.com">CORE SDI S.A.</A> an Information
Security company based in Buenos Aires, Argentina uses OpenBSD as the main
platform for operation and development of information security related
products. &quot;The robustness, portability and commitment to security
of OpenBSD, as well as the ability to run on different hardware platforms,
provides an ideal operating system for environments where security and high
availability are major concerns&quot; , says Ivan Arce, CORE SDI's CEO.</li><p>

<li>The <a href="http://www.umn.edu/"> University of Minnesota</a> uses
OpenBSD on Sun Sparc workstations for network monitoring and capacity
planning.  They query 53,000 (as of May 1999) different interfaces via
SNMP, logging more than 250MB of SNMP data to concatenated disk for
processing each month.  <p>

<li><a href="http://www.empirenet.net/">Empire Net</a>, an ISP in Bend,
Oregon, uses OpenBSD on Sun Sparc and Intel Pentium Pro machines for network
monitoring, routing (including wireless and DSL connections), web site
hosting, NFS, and anything else that needs to be both fast and secure.<p>

<li>
<a href="http://www.rtmx.com">RTMX Incorporated</a> produces an OpenBSD
derived, IEEE POSIX real time extended system solution. RTMX fully
re-implemented previously developed in-house IEEE POSIX realtime 
extensions using OpenBSD as a root source tree. Nearly all of the IEEE 
POSIX extensions have been added. Currently all OpenBSD features are 
supported, but only on the m68k, MIPS and PowerPC cpu types. Pentium 
and Alpha cpu versions are to be released soon. RTMX Inc. is 
also a licensed OSF Motif house, and has ported Motif 1.2.3 to most of 
the supported platforms.<p>

<li>
<a href="http://www.rtmx.net">RTMX Networking Services</a>, North Carolina,
USA, is using OpenBSD on multiple servers for Web, DNS and over 1000 e-mail
users in their community just West of Research Triangle. There is a mix
of AMD K-6, MicroSPARC-II and PowerPC systems in use, with more customer
sub-net servers coming on-line. RTMX.NET mirrors the OpenBSD 
<a href="http://openbsd.groupbsd.org">WWW</a> and 
<a href="ftp://openbsd.groupbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/">ftp</a> sites, 
and also provides an anonymous CVS repository 
(CVSROOT=anoncvs@openbsd.groupbsd.org:/cvs), all thanks to 47GB of disk 
space and a dedicated T1 connection.<p></li>

<li><a href=http://www.poppe.com>Poppe Tyson Europe</a> 
is using OpenBSD as a primary DNS, mailserver for
100+ mailboxes, and as their Website Development server for over 50
sites.<p>

<li>The
<a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/">Center for Information Technology Integration</a>
(CITI) at the University of Michigan uses OpenBSD as the basis
for many intensive research projects.
OpenBSD is used for developing and analyzing
<a href= "http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/sinciti/smartcard/">smart card</a>
contents and protocols, both in isolation and in real
applications. Plans are underway to issue cards
containing secure tokens for user logins and kerberos ticket acquisition.
OpenBSD is also used as a test platform for the 
<a href= "http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/mobile.html">mobile computing</a>
program at CITI. Internally "The Packet Vault" is an
OpenBSD machine that captures and records on cd-rom every packet on the
local 10 Mbps ethernet. Packet contents are encrypted to comply with
privacy requirements. This practice is used for intrusion detection. In
addition, a number of people within the department are using OpenBSD as
their primary operating system. <p>

<li>The <a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/">University of Alberta</a>
uses OpenBSD on SPARC and Intel hardware for proxy servers, Kerberos
servers, print servers, service monitoring, pre-emptive security
scanning, and incident response.  OpenBSD on Intel Hardware is used
for Firewalls and Lan-to-Lan VPN for the university's secured subnets
behind which all the University's new administrative systems
reside. OpenBSD is used for <A
HREF="http://www.ualberta.ca/~beck/authgw.html">authenticating
gateways</A> in front of public labs and public ethernet jacks in
approximately 40 locations across campus (about 1500 seats) to help
secure public internet access. The Department of Computing Science is using two
20 seat OpenBSD labs for undergraduate instruction.<p>

<li>Crown.Net is an internet service provider running almost completely on
a mixture of OpenBSD/sparc and OpenBSD/i386.  Our Web Servers(2), Mail
Server, Primary and Secondary DNS, and Radius servers all are running
OpenBSD/sparc and our shell server and several co-located servers are
running OpenBSD/i386.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.fscinternet.com">FSC Internet Corp.</a>, a large
Information Security and Internet development firm located in
Toronto, Canada, has used OpenBSD and its IPsec support to construct
a secure and flexible VPN for a multi-billion dollar client.  "We are
delighted with OpenBSD's performance, reliability, and pro-active
attitude towards security," says a company spokesperson. "We intend
to use OpenBSD in many future projects.  We believe strongly that
open-source solutions like OpenBSD are best able to provide the high
levels of security our clients require -- closed-source software
almost never receives the level of code review that OpenBSD is
committed to."<p>

<li><A HREF="http://www.softquad.com/">SoftQuad Software Inc.</A>,
makes of HTML and XML editing software, uses OpenBSD for their
gateway, FTP, and web services.<p>

<li>
<a href="http://www.hobbiton.org/">Hobbiton.org</a> uses OpenBSD to run 
their free shell server, as well as other systems.  The shell server, a 
single AMD K6/233, handles well over 10,000 users. "We tried OpenBSD 
after having constant security problems with other operating systems", says
Hobbiton's Leif Pedersen. "Since then, security in the operating system has 
not been a problem and, as an added bonus, the systems have been more stable."
