<h2><font color=#e00000>Users</font><hr></h2>
The term "users" has several connotations. <EM>End users</EM> often
want to meet other users of the system, to share ideas, problems and solutions,
and discuss the system over a meal or a beer. One of the best ways to do this
is with one of our 
<a href="groups.html">User Groups worldwide</a>.
<p>
Another connotation of the term is "who is using the system, and for what?",
and that is the subject of the rest of this page.  These <a 
href="#com">companies</a> and organisations trust OpenBSD's rigorous code audit 
and security-first development model. They use the system to build firewalls, 
intrusion detection systems, or general purpose servers. 
<a href="#edu">University researchers</a> and IT department developers often 
have similar security and stability requirements and choose OpenBSD.
Many <a href="#isp">Internet Service Providers</a> find OpenBSD's
security features hard to resist.

Amnesty International is a worldwide campaigning movement that works
to promote all the human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and other international standards.
Amnesty International is using OpenBSD for network firewalls and for
Virtual Private Networks (IPSec) between its sections around the world.<p>

<li><A HREF="http://www.iztacala.unam.mx">ENEP Iztacala</A><br>
ENEP Iztacala is one of <A HREF="http://www.unam.mx">UNAM</A>'s peripheral
schools. UNAM is Mexico's largest University, with over 250,000 students,
and at ENEP Iztacala we have a bit over 10,000 students. This is mostly
a health-oriented campus, so the computer area is not a big one.
<br>
We run as servers currently two OpenBSD, one Solaris and two Linux boxes.
With OpenBSD we handle the main web site (happily running on a 7-year old
Sparcstation 5), part of our mail accounts and our firewall.
<br>
There are two aditional OpenBSD computers, in our development area. One of
them acts as a network monitor (using Snort) and will shortly be moved to
sit next to the firewall, and the other one serves as an OpenBSD CVS
mirror (<strong>CVSROOT=anoncvs@anoncvs.mx.openbsd.org:/cvs</strong>).
<br>
We do not do run very creative stuff, we just use OpenBSD for what it does
best: run smoothly, even on older hardware, freeing us from most concerns
and doubts we have about our other operating systems.
<br>
We also host a Spanish OpenBSD mailing list (openbsd@tlali.iztacala.unam.mx).

<i>"After several break-ins, I converted my system from Linux to OpenBSD. Now
it runs all the software I used to use in Linux, including a full-featured
desktop (Helix Gnome), research and productivity software; Web pages for
courses I teach; and software to administer and grade exams (the break-ins on
my old Linux system always occurred during exam times). I was also attracted to
OpenBSD because of the superiority of its UVM virtual memory algorithm (also
used by NetBSD)."</i>

scanning, and incident response.  OpenBSD on Intel Hardware is used
for Firewalls and Lan-to-Lan VPN for the university's secured subnets

approximately 40 locations across campus (about 1500 seats) to help

<li>The University of Michigan's <a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/">
Center for Information Technology Integration (CITI)</a><br>
The CITI laboratory uses OpenBSD as the basis
for many intensive research projects.
OpenBSD is used for developing and analyzing
<a href= "http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/sinciti/smartcard/">smart card</a>
contents and protocols, both in isolation and in real
applications. Plans are underway to issue cards
containing secure tokens for user logins and kerberos ticket acquisition.
OpenBSD is also used as a test platform for the 
<a href= "http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/mobile.html">mobile computing</a>
program at CITI. Internally "The Packet Vault" is an
OpenBSD machine that captures and records on cd-rom every packet on the
local 10 Mbps ethernet. Packet contents are encrypted to comply with
privacy requirements. This practice is used for intrusion detection. In
addition, a number of people within the department are using OpenBSD as
their primary operating system. <p>

<li><a href="http://www.umn.edu/">The University of Minnesota</a><br>
This university uses OpenBSD on Sun Sparc workstations for network monitoring

via SNMP, logging more than 250MB of SNMP data to concatenated disk for
processing each month.<p>

attitude towards security," says a company spokesperson. "We intend
to use OpenBSD in many future projects.  We believe strongly that
open-source solutions like OpenBSD are best able to provide the high

<h2><font color=#e00000><a name="isp">Internet Service Providers</a></font></h2>
<p>
One goal of any ISP is to keep their customers' sites and accounts safe
from intrusion. OpenBSD's security record speaks for itself, so many
ISPs use OpenBSD for this reason alone. However, others use OpenBSD for
many, if not most, of their services.

BS Web Services, a german ISP, is using OpenBSD servers for primary and
secondary DNS (djbdns), primary Web hosting (Apache) and
primary mail services (qmail-ldap). They also run mission critical
LDAP Authentification Backend on OpenBSD (OpenLDAP), as well as MySQL databases.
Hostmaster Henning Brauer writes:<br>
<i>"OpenBSD needed some tuning on these machines, especially bigger maxprocs
and maxfiles, but it handles extraordinary loads on ordinary hardware. We are
using AMD Athlons (mostly the new Thunderbirds) and AMD K6-III's. We also have
some internal machines running OpenBSD as testbeds and printservers and all
sorts of other purposes. We plan to move some more machines to OpenBSD,
especially our firewalls. Unfortunately we are still running some closed
source software, but we'd like to try the Linux emulation. OpenBSD's
behaviour under high load, especially under DoS attacks, just doesn't
compare to the Linux we used before - Linux went extremely slow, while
OpenBSD doesn't even care (same hardware!)"</i>.

"The other thing I love about it is over half of the work is done to secure 
the box right after installation, saving my company copious amounts of time.
