OpenBSD is not just a kernel hackers' operating system. Several
corporations, universities, and ISP's are using OpenBSD to serve their IT,
research and security needs. The following list and associated statistics
should speak for themselves about the reliability and integrity of an
OpenBSD system.<br><br>

<i><b>NOTE:</b> Some companies for security purposes have asked that we do
not disclose the name of their business. To comply with these wishes you
may notice "Undisclosed Company" in some of our listings.</i><br><br>

<li><A HREF="http://www.core-sdi.com">CORE SDI S.A.</A> an Information
Security company based in Buenos Aires, Argentina uses OpenBSD as the main
platform for operation and development of information security related
products. &quot;The robustness, portability and commitment to security
of OpenBSD, as well as the ability to run on different hardware plataforms,
provides an ideal operating system for enviroments where security and high
availability are major concerns&quot; , says Ivan Arce, CORE SDI's CEO.</li>

<li><a href=http://www.secnet.com>Secure Networks, Inc.</a> 
has been using OpenBSD as their core development
platform for their flagship product, Ballista. According to a corporate
representative, "it [OpenBSD] has proven to be very stable, and quite well
supported for a free operating system." In addition, it should be noted
that code from the Ballista project developed on OpenBSD systems was
easily ported to Irix and Solaris. 

<li>The <a href="http://www.umn.edu/"> University of Minnesota</a> uses
OpenBSD on Sun Sparc workstations for network monitoring and capacity
planning.  They query 32,000 different interfaces via SNMP, logging
SNMP data to concatenated disk for processing each month.  

<li><a href="http://www.mac.edu">MacMurray College</a> of Jacksonville,
Illinois is using a P5/150 as its main server for over 600 students and
100 staff and faculty users. This system is also planned to be used by
the MacMurray Computer Science department for both the instrcution of 
programming and administration. By using OpenBSD on existing hardware,
MacMurray plans to save the thousands needed to keep a current version of
AIX running on their RS/6000 server.

<li><a href="http://www.rtmx.com">RTMX, Inc.</a>, produces an OpenBSD
derived, IEEE POSIX real time extended system solution. RTMX fully
re-implemented previously developed in-house IEEE POSIX realtime
extensions using OpenBSD as a root source tree. Nearly all of the IEEE
POSIX extensions have been added. Currently all OpenBSD features are
supported, but only a reasonable subset of the cpu types & platforms are
currently working. <br> 
RTMX is also a licensed OSF Motif house, and has ported Motif 1.2.3 to
most of the supported platforms. Yong Chen's VXP Motif GUI Builder has
been licensed for porting to OpenBSD/RTMX systems.  In addition, RTMX
plans to release a general purpose data base package in the
not-too-distant future.<br>
RTMX "believes strongly in the OpenBSD approach...and looks forward to
supporting the organization as it grows." 

<li><a href=http://www.poppe.com>Poppe Tyson Europe</a> 
is using OpenBSD as a primary DNS, mailserver for
100+ mailboxes, and as their Website Development server for over 50
sites.

<li>Felix Schr&ouml;ter is developing a generic IP tunneling program which
will be able to tunnel IP and other protocols (OS dependant), through a 
streams based connections. The software can optionally encrypt and
integrity check the packets it transfers. This software is aimed 
as a solution for VPN (virtual private networks).<br>
Felix is using OpenBSD because of the pseudo-device "tun" which makes 
getting IP and other protocol's packets from the kernel quite easily.<br>
Licensing negotiations for this product are still underway. Felix hopes to
provide a free license (binary and source) for non-commericial use.

<li><a href=http://www.tal.net>TAL Wireless Networks, Inc.</a> 
uses OpenBSD as a platform for multiple
firewall, http proxy and dialup and servers across California. Some of
these machines were formerly running the commercial version of BSD,
BSD/OS.  TALNET S.A., the Argentina based offices of TALNET are using
OpenBSD as a mail server, firewall and http proxy. 

<li><a href="http://www.etinc.com">Emerging Technologies Inc.</a> makes T1
and other synchronous communications hardware and software for the OpenBSD
platform. This hardware is in use in many ISPs world-wide and shows how
effectively OpenBSD can be used as a communications routing platform for
IP routing. These products allow OpenBSD-based machines to directly
connect ot 56kbs DDS, T1 lines or frame relay networks, eliminating the
need for an external router. <br>
On the software end, ET/BWMGR, ET's Bandwith Manager, a part of their
software drivers, has been ported to the OpenBSD platform. The bandwith
manager can effectively be used as a solution for network managers who
need to tune bandwith usage, control the bandwith of their client sites,
and clear up network bottlenecks. 

<li>An undisclosed company is using OpenBSD on a Sparc 1+ as a private
firewall and WWW server for 50-100 internal client workstations. 

<li>The
<a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/">Center for Information Technology Integration</a>
(CITI) at the University of Michigan uses OpenBSD as the basis
for many intensive research projects.
OpenBSD is used for developing and analysing
<a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/sinciti/smartcard/">smart card</a>
contents and protocols, both in isolation and in real
applications. Plans are underway to issue cards
containing secure tokens for user logins and kerberos ticket acquisition.
OpenBSD is also used as a test platform for the 
<a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/mobile.html">mobile computing</a>
program at CITI. Internally "The Packet Vault" is an
OpenBSD machine that captures and records on cd-rom every packet on the
local 10 Mbps ethernet. Packet contents are encrypted to comply with
privacy requirements. This practice is used for intrusion detection. In
addition, a number of people within the department are using OpenBSD as
their primary operating system.
