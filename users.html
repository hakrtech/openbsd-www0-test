<h2><font color=#e00000>Users</font><hr></h2>
The term "users" has several connotations. <EM>End users</EM> often
want to meet other users of the system, to share ideas, problems and solutions,
and discuss the system over a meal or a beer. One of the best ways to do this
is with one of our 
<a href="groups.html">User Groups worldwide</a>.
<p>
Another connotation of the term is "who is using the system, and for what?",
and that is the subject of the rest of this page.
These companies and organisations trust OpenBSD's rigorous code audit 
and security-first development model. They use the system to build firewalls, 
intrusion detection systems, or general purpose servers. University 
researchers and IT department developers often have similar 
security and stability requirements and choose OpenBSD.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.core-sdi.com">CORE SDI S.A.</a><br>
An Information Security company based in Buenos Aires, Argentina uses OpenBSD
as the main platform for operation and development of information security related
products. &quot;The robustness, portability and commitment to security
of OpenBSD, as well as the ability to run on different hardware platforms,
provides an ideal operating system for environments where security and high
availability are major concerns&quot; , says Ivan Arce, CORE SDI's CEO.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.qpalzm.com">qpalzm.com services</a><br>
qpalzm services runs OpenBSD to offer web hosting and shell accounts. The
website offers daily updates on programming, gaming, irc, and other
technobabble. An online MUD is also available. There is also a 
<a href="http://www.jscript.org">JavaScript Mailing List</a>
using OpenBSD for the benefit of those interested in JavaScript
and DHTML. Incidently, qpalzm.com's busy WWW, FTP and mail server runs 
just fine with OpenBSD on a 200MHz Pentium Pro.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.ioactive.com/">IOActive</a><br>
IOActive provides WWW developers and hackers with a place to tinker on test 
servers.  The Seattle, WA, service provider also installs OpenBSD firewall,
VPN and IDS systems for regional businesses. "OpenBSD is fast, reliable, and I 
sleep a little better at night knowing I'm using it," says owner Josh Pennell.
"The other thing I love about it is over half of the work is done to secure 
the box right after installation, saving my company copious amounts of time.
OpenBSD in my mind is the defacto standard for open source secure operating
systems.  Everyone else is just trying to catch up".<p>

<li><a href="http://www.umn.edu/">The University of Minnesota</a><br>
This university uses OpenBSD on Sun Sparc workstations for network monitoring
and capacity planning.  They query 53,000 (as of May 1999) different interfaces
via SNMP, logging more than 250MB of SNMP data to concatenated disk for
processing each month.<p>

co-location customers and business park tenants.<P>

<li><a href="http://www.rtmx.com">RTMX Incorporated</a><br>
This vendor produces an OpenBSD derived, IEEE POSIX real time extended
system solution. RTMX fully re-implemented previously developed
in-house IEEE POSIX realtime extensions using OpenBSD as a root source
tree. Nearly all of the IEEE POSIX extensions have been
added. Currently all OpenBSD features are supported, but only on the
m68k, MIPS and PowerPC cpu types. Pentium and Alpha cpu versions are
to be released soon. RTMX Inc. is also a licensed OSF Motif house, and
has ported Motif 1.2.3 to most of the supported platforms.<p>

This North Carolina ISP is using OpenBSD on multiple servers for Web,
DNS and over 1000 e-mail users in their community just West of
Research Triangle. There is a mix of AMD K-6, MicroSPARC-II and
PowerPC systems in use, with more customer sub-net servers coming
on-line. RTMX.NET mirrors the OpenBSD
<a href="http://openbsd.groupbsd.org">WWW</a>
and <a href="ftp://openbsd.groupbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/">ftp</a> sites,
and also provides an anonymous CVS repository

<li><a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/">The Center for Information Technology Integration (CITI)</a><br>
This laboratory at the University of Michigan uses OpenBSD as the basis
for many intensive research projects.
OpenBSD is used for developing and analyzing
<a href= "http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/sinciti/smartcard/">smart card</a>
contents and protocols, both in isolation and in real
applications. Plans are underway to issue cards
containing secure tokens for user logins and kerberos ticket acquisition.
OpenBSD is also used as a test platform for the 
<a href= "http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/mobile.html">mobile computing</a>
program at CITI. Internally "The Packet Vault" is an
OpenBSD machine that captures and records on cd-rom every packet on the
local 10 Mbps ethernet. Packet contents are encrypted to comply with
privacy requirements. This practice is used for intrusion detection. In
addition, a number of people within the department are using OpenBSD as
their primary operating system. <p>

<li><a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/">The University of Alberta</a><br>
uses OpenBSD on SPARC and Intel hardware for proxy servers, Kerberos
servers, print servers, service monitoring, pre-emptive security
scanning, and incident response.  OpenBSD on Intel Hardware is used
for Firewalls and Lan-to-Lan VPN for the university's secured subnets
behind which all the University's new administrative systems
reside. OpenBSD is used for <A
HREF="http://www.ualberta.ca/~beck/authgw.html">authenticating
gateways</A> in front of public labs and public ethernet jacks in
approximately 40 locations across campus (about 1500 seats) to help
secure public internet access. The Department of Computing Science is using two
20 seat OpenBSD labs for undergraduate instruction.<p>

<li><a href=http://www.crown.net>Crown.Net</a><br>
This internet service provider is running almost completely on
a mixture of OpenBSD/sparc and OpenBSD/i386.  Our Web Servers(2), Mail
Server, Primary and Secondary DNS, and Radius servers all are running
OpenBSD/sparc and our shell server and several co-located servers are
running OpenBSD/i386.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.fscinternet.com">FSC Internet Corp.</a><br>
A large Information Security and Internet development firm located in
Toronto, has used OpenBSD and its IPsec support to construct
a secure and flexible VPN for a multi-billion dollar client.  "We are
delighted with OpenBSD's performance, reliability, and pro-active
attitude towards security," says a company spokesperson. "We intend
to use OpenBSD in many future projects.  We believe strongly that
open-source solutions like OpenBSD are best able to provide the high
levels of security our clients require -- closed-source software
almost never receives the level of code review that OpenBSD is
committed to."<p>

<li><a href="http://www.softquad.com/">SoftQuad Software Inc.</a><br>
This maker of HTML and XML editing software, uses OpenBSD for their
gateway, FTP, and web services.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.hobbiton.org/">Hobbiton.org</a><br>
This ISP uses OpenBSD to run their free shell server, as well as other
systems.  The shell server, a single AMD K6/233, handles well over
10,000 users. "We tried OpenBSD after having constant security
problems with other operating systems", says Hobbiton's Leif
Pedersen. "Since then, security in the operating system has not been a
problem and, as an added bonus, the systems have been more stable."

<li>Prague Institute of Chemical Technology, Czech Republic<br>
The university uses OpenBSD on PCs to provide WWW, mail and shell access to 
staff and students, and on a SPARC IPX for a time server and secondary DNS. 
The admin stations also run PCs with OpenBSD.
