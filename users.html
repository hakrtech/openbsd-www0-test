These companies and organisations trust OpenBSD's rigorous code audit 
and security-first development model. They use the system to build firewalls, 
intrusion detection systems, or general purpose servers. University 
researchers and IT department developers often have similar 
security and stability requirements and choose OpenBSD.<p>

This network and computer security firm uses OpenBSD for high speed
intrusion detection, virtual private networking, and data warehousing
applications.  Network Security Technologies, Inc is located in the
Washington DC metro area, and uses OpenBSD at several undisclosed
military and government agency locations.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe Systems</a><br>
This software giant uses OpenBSD on a number of their network firewalls
and network testing systems.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.calyx.net">Calyx Internet Access Corp.</a><br>
This web farm company uses 
OpenBSD for running all mission-critical services including WWW, FTP and 
email as well as for network monitoring at its data centers in New York 
and Amsterdam.  Even larger web sites such as 
<A HREF="http://www.snapple.com">snapple.com</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.tanqueray.com">tanqueray.com</A> and others are no 
challenge for OpenBSD.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.alteon.com">Alteon Networks</a><br>
The gigabit ethernet
hardware manufacturer, uses OpenBSD machines in varying capacities ranging
from testbeds to gateways.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.core-sdi.com">CORE SDI S.A.</a><br>
An Information Security company based in Buenos Aires, Argentina uses OpenBSD
as the main platform for operation and development of information security related
products. &quot;The robustness, portability and commitment to security
of OpenBSD, as well as the ability to run on different hardware platforms,
provides an ideal operating system for environments where security and high
availability are major concerns&quot; , says Ivan Arce, CORE SDI's CEO.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.umn.edu/">The University of Minnesota</a><br>
This university uses OpenBSD on Sun Sparc workstations for network monitoring
and capacity planning.  They query 53,000 (as of May 1999) different interfaces
via SNMP, logging more than 250MB of SNMP data to concatenated disk for
processing each month.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.empirenet.net/">Empire Net</a><br>
An ISP in Bend, Oregon, uses OpenBSD on Sun Sparc and Intel Pentium Pro
machines for network monitoring, routing (including wireless and DSL
connections), web site hosting, NFS, and anything else that needs to
be both fast and secure.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.rtmx.com">RTMX Incorporated</a><br>
This vendor produces an OpenBSD derived, IEEE POSIX real time extended
system solution. RTMX fully re-implemented previously developed
in-house IEEE POSIX realtime extensions using OpenBSD as a root source
tree. Nearly all of the IEEE POSIX extensions have been
added. Currently all OpenBSD features are supported, but only on the
m68k, MIPS and PowerPC cpu types. Pentium and Alpha cpu versions are
to be released soon. RTMX Inc. is also a licensed OSF Motif house, and
has ported Motif 1.2.3 to most of the supported platforms.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.rtmx.net">RTMX Networking Services</a><br>
This North Carolina ISP is using OpenBSD on multiple servers for Web,
DNS and over 1000 e-mail users in their community just West of
Research Triangle. There is a mix of AMD K-6, MicroSPARC-II and
PowerPC systems in use, with more customer sub-net servers coming
on-line. RTMX.NET mirrors the OpenBSD
<a href="http://openbsd.groupbsd.org">WWW</a>
and <a href="ftp://openbsd.groupbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/">ftp</a> sites,
and also provides an anonymous CVS repository
(CVSROOT=anoncvs@openbsd.groupbsd.org:/cvs), all thanks to 47GB of
disk space and a dedicated T1 connection.<p>

<li><a href=http://www.poppe.com>Poppe Tyson Europe</a>

is using OpenBSD as a primary DNS, mailserver for
100+ mailboxes, and as their Website Development server for over 50
sites.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/">The Center for Information Technology Integration (CITI)</a><br>
This laboratory at the University of Michigan uses OpenBSD as the basis
for many intensive research projects.
OpenBSD is used for developing and analyzing
<a href= "http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/sinciti/smartcard/">smart card</a>
contents and protocols, both in isolation and in real
applications. Plans are underway to issue cards
containing secure tokens for user logins and kerberos ticket acquisition.
OpenBSD is also used as a test platform for the 
<a href= "http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/mobile.html">mobile computing</a>
program at CITI. Internally "The Packet Vault" is an
OpenBSD machine that captures and records on cd-rom every packet on the
local 10 Mbps ethernet. Packet contents are encrypted to comply with
privacy requirements. This practice is used for intrusion detection. In
addition, a number of people within the department are using OpenBSD as
their primary operating system. <p>

<li><a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/">The University of Alberta</a><br>
uses OpenBSD on SPARC and Intel hardware for proxy servers, Kerberos
servers, print servers, service monitoring, pre-emptive security
scanning, and incident response.  OpenBSD on Intel Hardware is used
for Firewalls and Lan-to-Lan VPN for the university's secured subnets
behind which all the University's new administrative systems
reside. OpenBSD is used for <A
HREF="http://www.ualberta.ca/~beck/authgw.html">authenticating
gateways</A> in front of public labs and public ethernet jacks in
approximately 40 locations across campus (about 1500 seats) to help
secure public internet access. The Department of Computing Science is using two
20 seat OpenBSD labs for undergraduate instruction.<p>

<li><a href=http://www.crown.net>Crown.Net</a><br>
This internet service provider is running almost completely on
a mixture of OpenBSD/sparc and OpenBSD/i386.  Our Web Servers(2), Mail
Server, Primary and Secondary DNS, and Radius servers all are running
OpenBSD/sparc and our shell server and several co-located servers are
running OpenBSD/i386.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.fscinternet.com">FSC Internet Corp.</a><br>
A large Information Security and Internet development firm located in
Toronto, has used OpenBSD and its IPsec support to construct
a secure and flexible VPN for a multi-billion dollar client.  "We are
delighted with OpenBSD's performance, reliability, and pro-active
attitude towards security," says a company spokesperson. "We intend
to use OpenBSD in many future projects.  We believe strongly that
open-source solutions like OpenBSD are best able to provide the high
levels of security our clients require -- closed-source software
almost never receives the level of code review that OpenBSD is
committed to."<p>

<li><a href="http://www.softquad.com/">SoftQuad Software Inc.</a><br>
This maker of HTML and XML editing software, uses OpenBSD for their
gateway, FTP, and web services.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.hobbiton.org/">Hobbiton.org</a><br>
This ISP uses OpenBSD to run their free shell server, as well as other
systems.  The shell server, a single AMD K6/233, handles well over
10,000 users. "We tried OpenBSD after having constant security
problems with other operating systems", says Hobbiton's Leif
Pedersen. "Since then, security in the operating system has not been a
problem and, as an added bonus, the systems have been more stable."
