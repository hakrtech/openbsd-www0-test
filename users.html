OpenBSD is not just a kernel hackers' operating system. Several
corporations, universities, and ISP's are using OpenBSD to serve their IT,
research and security needs. The following list and associated statistics
should speak for themselves about the reliability and integrity of an
OpenBSD system.<br><br>

not disclose the name of their business. To comply with these wishes you

<li>Software giant <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe Systems</A>
uses OpenBSD on a number of their network firewalls and network
testing systems.

<li><A HREF="http://www.calyx.net">Calyx Internet Access Corp.</A> uses 
OpenBSD for running all mission-critical services including WWW, FTP and 
email as well as for network monitoring at its data centers in New York 
and Amsterdam.  Even larger web sites such as 
<A HREF="http://www.snapple.com">snapple.com</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.tanqueray.com">tanqueray.com</A> and others are no 
challenge for OpenBSD.

<li><A HREF="http://www.alteon.com">Alteon Networks</A> the gigabit ethernet
hardware manufacturer, uses OpenBSD machines in varying capacities ranging
from testbeds to gateways.

<li><A HREF="http://www.core-sdi.com">CORE SDI S.A.</A> an Information
Security company based in Buenos Aires, Argentina uses OpenBSD as the main
platform for operation and development of information security related
products. &quot;The robustness, portability and commitment to security
of OpenBSD, as well as the ability to run on different hardware platforms,
provides an ideal operating system for environments where security and high
availability are major concerns&quot; , says Ivan Arce, CORE SDI's CEO.</li>

<li><a href=http://www.secnet.com>Secure Networks, Inc.</a> 
has been using OpenBSD as their core development
platform for their flagship product, Ballista. According to a corporate
representative, "it [OpenBSD] has proven to be very stable, and quite well
supported for a free operating system." In addition, it should be noted
that code from the Ballista project developed on OpenBSD systems was
easily ported to Irix and Solaris. 

<li>The <a href="http://www.umn.edu/"> University of Minnesota</a> uses
OpenBSD on Sun Sparc workstations for network monitoring and capacity
planning.  They query 32,000 different interfaces via SNMP, logging
SNMP data to concatenated disk for processing each month.  

<li><a href="http://www.empirenet.net/">Empire Net</a>, an ISP in Bend,
Oregon, uses OpenBSD on Sun Sparc and Intel Pentium Pro machines for network
monitoring, routing (including wireless and DSL connections), web site
hosting, NFS, and anything else that needs to be both fast and secure..

<li><a href="http://www.mac.edu">MacMurray College</a> of Jacksonville,
Illinois is using a P5/150 as its main server for over 600 students and
100 staff and faculty users. This system is also planned to be used by
the MacMurray Computer Science department for both the instruction of 
programming and administration. By using OpenBSD on existing hardware,
MacMurray plans to save the thousands needed to keep a current version of
AIX running on their RS/6000 server.

<li><a href="http://www.rtmx.com">RTMX, Inc.</a>, produces an OpenBSD
derived, IEEE POSIX real time extended system solution. RTMX fully
re-implemented previously developed in-house IEEE POSIX realtime
extensions using OpenBSD as a root source tree. Nearly all of the IEEE
POSIX extensions have been added. Currently all OpenBSD features are
supported, but only a reasonable subset of the cpu types &amp; platforms are
currently working. <br> 
RTMX is also a licensed OSF Motif house, and has ported Motif 1.2.3 to
most of the supported platforms. Yong Chen's VXP Motif GUI Builder has
been licensed for porting to OpenBSD/RTMX systems.  In addition, RTMX
plans to release a general purpose data base package in the
not-too-distant future.<br>
RTMX "believes strongly in the OpenBSD approach...and looks forward to
supporting the organization as it grows." 

<li><a href=http://www.poppe.com>Poppe Tyson Europe</a> 
is using OpenBSD as a primary DNS, mailserver for
100+ mailboxes, and as their Website Development server for over 50
sites.

<li>Felix Schr&ouml;ter is developing a generic IP tunneling program which
will be able to tunnel IP and other protocols (OS dependent), through a 
streams based connections. The software can optionally encrypt and
integrity check the packets it transfers. This software is aimed 
as a solution for VPN (virtual private networks).<br>
Felix is using OpenBSD because of the pseudo-device "tun" which makes 
getting IP and other protocol's packets from the kernel quite easily.<br>
Licensing negotiations for this product are still underway. Felix hopes to
provide a free license (binary and source) for non-commercial use.

<li><a href=http://www.tal.net>TAL Wireless Networks, Inc.</a> 
uses OpenBSD as a platform for multiple
firewall, http proxy and dialup and servers across California. Some of
these machines were formerly running the commercial version of BSD,
BSD/OS.  TALNET S.A., the Argentina based offices of TALNET are using
OpenBSD as a mail server, firewall and http proxy. 

<li>An undisclosed company is using OpenBSD on a Sparc 1+ as a private
firewall and WWW server for 50-100 internal client workstations. 

<li>The
<a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/">Center for Information Technology Integration</a>
(CITI) at the University of Michigan uses OpenBSD as the basis
for many intensive research projects.
OpenBSD is used for developing and analyzing
<a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/sinciti/smartcard/">smart card</a>
contents and protocols, both in isolation and in real
applications. Plans are underway to issue cards
containing secure tokens for user logins and kerberos ticket acquisition.
OpenBSD is also used as a test platform for the 
<a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/mobile.html">mobile computing</a>
program at CITI. Internally "The Packet Vault" is an
OpenBSD machine that captures and records on cd-rom every packet on the
local 10 Mbps ethernet. Packet contents are encrypted to comply with
privacy requirements. This practice is used for intrusion detection. In
addition, a number of people within the department are using OpenBSD as
their primary operating system. 

<li>The <a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/">University of Alberta</a> uses
OpenBSD on SPARC and Intel hardware for proxy servers in front of labs and 
student residences, Kerberos servers, and web based
course services using <A href="http://homebrew.cs.ubc.ca/webct/">WebCT</A>.
The Department of Computing Science is using a 20 seat OpenBSD lab for 
teaching introductory Unix and programming courses.

<li>webFreaks.com, LLC is a new startup company of 3 employess in Silicon
Valley.  Our shell account server currently has 300-400 users running on
AMD and Cyrix CPUs connected to the internet via 384K ADSL (there are 2
locations in Mountain View and Cupertino, CA, each connected with ADSL).
We also custom design webpages and banner ads.

<li>Crown.Net is an internet service provider running almost completely on
a mixture of OpenBSD/sparc and OpenBSD/i386.  Our Web Servers(2), Mail
Server, Primary and Secondary DNS, and Radius servers all are running
OpenBSD/sparc and our shell server and several co-located servers are
running OpenBSD/i386.

<li><a href="http://www.fscinternet.com">FSC Internet Corp.</a>, a large
Information Security and Internet development firm located in
Toronto, Canada, has used OpenBSD and its IPsec support to construct
a secure and flexible VPN for a multi-billion dollar client.  "We are
delighted with OpenBSD's performance, reliability, and pro-active
attitude towards security," says a company spokesperson. "We intend
to use OpenBSD in many future projects.  We believe strongly that
open-source solutions like OpenBSD are best able to provide the high
levels of security our clients require -- closed-source software
almost never receives the level of code review that OpenBSD is
committed to."

<li><A HREF="http://www.softquad.com/">SoftQuad Software Inc.</A>,
makes of HTML and XML editing software, uses OpenBSD for their
gateway, FTP, and web services.
