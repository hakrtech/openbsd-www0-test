<h2><font color="#e00000">Bank Transfer Donations</font></h2>
<hr>

For transfers to our Europe bank account, it is easy to donate money
to OpenBSD using direct bank transfers.

<ul>
<li><font color="#e00000">IBAN users: (people in the Euro zone)</font><br>
Please wire the money to our Belgian bank account:
<p>
IBAN <b>BE93737017743767</b><br>
BIC <b>KREDBEBB</b><br>
<br>
Name: OpenBSD<br>
Address: Oostveld Kouter 13<br>
9920 Lovendegem<br>
Belgium<br>
<p>
As a comment, give the name you want to see listed on our
<a href="donations.html">Donations page</a>.
<p>
As for wire transfer costs, with the new IBAN system there should
NOT BE ANY COSTS when the transfer is made between two banks within the
European Community. If there is an option, you should select 'share both
costs' as that will put you into the 'EUR 0.00 charge'. Sometimes if you
select 'charge all costs to sender' (or receiver), they do charge outrageous
costs.  This is plain wrong as all transactions should be charged at the
same cost as a national transfer, as per 01-06-2003. You should complain
if they do.
<p>
Be careful not to use the old SWIFT system as that is fairly expensive.
As well, note that Greek banks are notorious for charging costs at the
expense of customers...  For example, Eurobank charges EUR 5 for
outgoing transfers and EUR 3 for incoming ones...
<p>
