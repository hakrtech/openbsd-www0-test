<P>OpenBSD has attracted a critical mass of developers, support
organizations, and consultants such that it is now safe to commit to using 
OpenBSD in your projects.
The following individuals and organizations have indicated that they are
able to provide support as indicated. However, the OpenBSD Project does
not necessarily endorse any of these. Please contact each site directly.
</P>
<P>These entries are arranged geographically, so that you can find
a consultant near you.
<P>If you want to submit your own entry, the format is quite rigid; please use
<A HREF="support-template.txt">this template</A> (do not just
copy and paste plain text from your browser!).
When you think it's ready, mail it to me, 
<A href="mailto:ian@darwinsys.com">ian@darwinsys.com</A>.
If you have commit access, install it in support.dat in the CVS tree,
but please be sure to keep the entries alphabetical by country and within
the country by last name.
</P>
