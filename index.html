<h3><hr><a name=additions>Changes Relative to other *BSD's.</a></h3>

<p>
OpenBSD looks a lot like NetBSD (which it is derived from, following
the 4.4BSD roots), but is now being developed seperately.  Good changes
from other free operating systems will be merged in (of course, depending
on various factors like developer time for example.)  OpenBSD tracks
NetBSD changes very closely; say anywhere between 2 days to 10 days
behind the state of NetBSD-current all the time.  Hence you can truly
say that OpenBSD is NetBSD <b>PLUS MORE STUFF</b>.
</p>

<p>
Various additions have been made. This is only a small partial list of
the major machine independent changes (ie. it is the most interesting
changes or what people ask about most often). Check the specific port
you are interested in for further details of that port -- many of them
have been extended too.
<ul>
<li>Many many NetBSD PR's fixed (which NetBSD has not yet fixed)
<li>New curses library, including libform, libpanel and libmenu.
<li>a termlib library which understands termcap.db, needed for new curses. 
<li>The FreeBSD ports subsystem was integrated and is usable by you! 
<li>ipfilter for filtering dangerous packets
<li>better ELF support
<li>nlist() that understands ELF, ECOFF, and a.out, allowing non-a.out ports
	to use kvm utilies 
<li>Verbatim integration of the GNU tools (using a wrapper Makefile)
<li>All the pieces needed for cross compilation are in the source tree.
<li>Some LKM support in the tree.
<li>ATAPI support (should work on all ISA busses)
<li>new scsi, md5, pkg_* commands
<li>Numerous security related fixes
<li>Kerberos and other crypto in the source tree that is exportable
<li>Solid YP master, server, and client capabilities.
<li>/dev/rnd -- source of random data
<li>In-kernel update(8) with an adaptive algorithm
<li>Some ddb improvements and extensions
<li>Numerous scsi fixes
<li>ncheck utility for ffs
<li>/sbin/init now deals with non-existant ttys, no longer spins gettys madly.
<li>new system calls: rfork(), minherit(), poll().
<li>select() that can handle any amount of file descriptors.
<li>kernfs extensions
<li>ATM support (support for one company's sparc & i386 cards available)
<li>Boot kernels with "-c" to edit/enable/disable device configuration tables
<li>pax as tar, gnutar is toast
<li>using AT&T awk, gawk is toast
<li>Even more security fixes.
<li>Accepts FreeBSD MD5 passwords in password maps, soon will be able to
	generate them too
<li>Linux ext2fs and BSD4.4 LFS support being worked on.
<li>Working ATAPI audio support for multiple architectures.
<li>terminfo database support.
<li>Fortran in the tree.
<li>The most secure rdist support anywhere.
<li>randomized port allocation in bind(), bindresvport(), and rresvport() --
	security via unpredictability.
<li>Protection from the udp spamming and ftp bounce attacks.
<li>Significantly improved ftp daemon.
<li>Numerous more security policy and implimentation improvements (OpenBSD
	defaults to installing in a very secure mode)
<li>zlib (non-GPL'd gzip-compatible library)
<li>Newest version of pppd.
<li>_POSIX_SAVED_IDS behaviour with permitted BSD extensions.
<li>Fixed long-standing vm swap-leak.
<li>FreeBSD malloc() that uses mmap() and is able to free unused memory.
<li>Numerous FreeBSD userland fixes and improvements incorporated.
<li>new rdisc Router Discovery daemon
<li>generic protection against the bind() takeover problem.
<li>at -f security fix. 
<li>install now supports -C, -p, and -S flags.
<!-- <li>a real adduser program, which can even be used uninteractively. -->
<li>POSIX & C2 requirement; lose setuid/setgid bits if owner/group changed
	by chown(). This can be turned off with sysctl.
<li>partial protection against tcp SYN attacks.
<li>added /etc/fbtab support to login & init.
<li>RCS version 5.7
<li>much newer join command (4.4lite2 with other fixes)
<li>scsi subsystem security fix
<li>Kerberos is much more silent if not configured
<li>arc4-based random support in kernel
<li>ncr53cXXX scsi scripts assembler
<li>Numerous ftpd improvements and fixes, including multihomed support.
<li>`lsof'-style features in fstat.
<li>/bin/ksh (latest version of pdksh) with more fixes.
<li>rudimentary support for ISA Plug-and-Play cards
<li>Fixed timeout support in RPC library, and also fixed it to support more than
	FD_SETSIZE file descriptors.
<li>improved locate command
<li>a good start at NETIPX support
<li>vi version 1.75
<li>gcc 2.7.2.1 (to get closer to native alpha support and fix a few other gcc
	bugs).
<li>latest version of perl, and a lndir command.
<li>Even more security fixes.
<li>cdio command for using CD audio. 
<li>Kernel warns if /dev/console does not exist; nice warning for booting with an
	unpopulated /dev directory.
<li>libgnumalloc is gone; our malloc library is better.
</ul>
</p>

<h3><hr><a name=curplat>Platforms currently supported.</a></h3>

<p>
Note: for some of these platforms, the platform-dependent code may
be identical to that found in NetBSD because there isn't a specific
OpenBSD developer.  For other ports the differences are significant.
If you find an empty page that means nothing of consequence that is
directly port-specific has changed from NetBSD.  (Of course there are
differences, but they just aren't in the /sys/arch/XXXX directory).

<p>
<dd>Snapshots will be made available from time to time on the ftp mirrors.
The snapshots are available on each of the FTP servers listed below,
typically in the directory <strong>OpenBSD/snapshots</strong>.
You should also read the <a href=snapshots.html>general description

<dt><h4><a name=maillist>MAILING LISTS:</a></h4>
<dd>Some mailing lists are used for the development and use of OpenBSD.
In each case, send mail to
<a href=mailto:majordomo@OpenBSD.org>majordomo@OpenBSD.org</a>
with a message body of "<strong>subscribe mailing-list-name</strong>".

There is a only minimal set of mailing lists intentionally; among
other benefits such as more communication it reduces cross-posting.
There are no private mailing lists.
<p>
These are the mailing lists:
<dl>
<dt><strong>announce</strong>
<dd>important announcements. Since this is a low volume list
it is excellent for people who just want to follow important events.
<dt><strong>tech</strong>
<dd>technical discussions
<dt><strong>misc</strong>
<dd>user questions and answers
<dt><strong>source-changes</strong>
<dd>automated mailout of CVS source tree changes
</dl>

<p>
For further assistance, send a message body of "<strong>help</strong>"
to <a href=mailto:majordomo@OpenBSD.org>majordomo@OpenBSD.org</a>
and you will receive a reply outlining all your options.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, a
<a href=http://www.sigmasoft.com/~openbsd>mailing list archive</a>
is available.
</p>

</dl>
<dl><h4><a name=gnats>BUG TRACKING:</a></h4>
<dd>We run GNATS for tracking bugs:
<a href=/cgi-bin/wwwgnats.pl>Click here to enter the bug tracking system.</a>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt><h4><a name=sup>SUP:</a></h4>
<dd>Sorry, unlike other *BSD projects, the SUP service is not
available.  We do not believe the SUP service to be a good tool for
source code access. But read below for the description of the
<a href="#anoncvs"><strong>anoncvs</strong> service!</a>

<dt><h4><a name=anoncvs>CVS Access:</a></h4>
<dd>CVS is used to manage the OpenBSD source tree. This allows
developers to work on a local source tree and commit their changes when
ready.  Also <strong>anyone</strong> can edit source files on their
local machines, and automatically track and merge in any changes made
in the OpenBSD CVS repository. Additionally they can easily see the
logs of, check out, or "diff" the source files in the OpenBSD source
tree.
</p>

<p>
Most importantly, the <strong>anoncvs</strong> service does NOT
delete the changes you make in your local copy of the source tree --
read on for more details!
</p>

<p>
The latest version of CVS is available at
<a href=ftp://ftp.cyclic.com/pub/cvs/>Cyclic</a>.
Versions earlier than 1.6 are not recommended, and may not work.
If you already have OpenBSD installed, CVS is included.
</p>

<p>
There are two levels of source tree access:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Read-write access for developers:</strong>
<dd>Developers who need to commit changes to the source tree must have
an account on the OpenBSD machines.  Getting this access will be a
natural result of working on the sources with other OpenBSD developers.
If someone does some good work and shows they can work with the team,
they will get an account.
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Read-only access for everyone:</strong>
<dd>Anyone can access the read-only CVS repositories. These copies
of the read-write CVS repository are mirrored often. To use one,
set your <strong>CVSROOT</strong> environment variable to one of
the following values:
<ul>
<p>
<li><strong>CVSROOT=anoncvs@anoncvs.usa.openbsd.org:/cvs</strong><br>

<p>
You may want to use `traceroute' to find out which server is nearest you.
</dl>
</p>

<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong>
There are a few issues relating to cryptographic software that everyone
should be aware of:
<ul>
<li>The OpenBSD sources are from Canada.
<a href=http://insight.mcmaster.ca/org/efc/pages/doc/crypto-export.html>It
is legal to export crypto software from Canada to the world.</a>
<p>
<li>However, if you are outside the USA or Canada, you should not
fetch the cryptographic sections of the OpenBSD sources from an
anoncvs server located in the USA. The files in question are...
<ul>
<li>src/kerberosIV/*
<li>src/lib/libc/crypt/crypt.c
<li>src/lib/libc/crypt/morecrypt.c
</ul>
Because of the USA ITAR munitions list,
crypto software may only be exported to Canada from the USA.
<p>
<li>The OpenBSD project is looking for more anoncvs servers -- read
on to find out how you can help.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
A sample use of an anoncvs CVS server would be:
<pre>
% setenv CVSROOT anoncvs@anoncvs.usa.openbsd.org:/cvs
% cd /tmp
% cvs get src/sys/arch/sparc
[copies the files from the repository to your machine]
% cvs log src/sys/arch/sparc/sparc/locore.s
[shows the commit log for the chosen file ]
% cvs diff -bc -r1.1 -r1.5 src/sys/arch/sparc/sparc/locore.s
[shows the changes between revisions 1.1 and rev 1.5]
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Here is how someone using anoncvs regularily would update his
source tree:
<pre>
# setenv CVSROOT anoncvs@anoncvs.usa.openbsd.org:/cvs
# cd /usr
# cvs -q get -PA src
</pre>
or similarily later on he might try
<pre>
# cd /usr/src
# cvs -q up -PAd
</pre>
Everytime you ran this it would syncronize your /usr/src tree. It would
not destroy any of your local changes, rather it would attempt to merge
changes in. If you use obj directories (not obj symbolic links) you may
wish to append "-I obj" to the cvs command line, this will keep cvs from
spitting out a warning about all the obj directories it is going to
encounter which are not in the repository.
</p>

<p>
The CVS man page (included with the CVS sources) has much more
information about how CVS can be used.
</p>

<p>
The anoncvs service gives fledgling developers a chance to learn CVS
operation and get thoroughly involved in the development process
before getting "commit" access -- as a result of showing useful
skills and high quality results they will naturally later be given
developer access.  As well, people providing patches can create
their "diff"s relative to the CVS tree, which will ease integration.
</p>

<p>
The CVS client uses rsh to talk to the CVS server.  If some local
security measure like a firewall (or imperfect protocol emulators
like slirp) prevents you from using rsh, you may be able to use
<a href=http://www.cs.hut.fi/ssh>ssh</a> instead.  In this case,
one sets the environment variable <strong>CVS_RSH</strong> to point
to ssh (typically <strong>/usr/local/bin/ssh</strong>). To reduce the
performance hit the anoncvs server would take it is recommended (and
requested) that you disable encryption.  If your local site prevents
you from connecting out to port 22 (which ssh defaults to using) use
port 2022.
</p>

<p>
Do not be tempted to turn on compression since CVS already compresses.
Use something like the following in your <strong>$HOME/.ssh/config</strong>
file.
</p>
<pre>
	Host anoncvs.usa.openbsd.org
	    Cipher none
	    Port 2022
</pre>

<p>
CVS is a little noisy starting up; to quiet it a bit you may want to
do this:
<pre>
setenv CVS_CLIENT_PORT -1
</pre>
</p>

<p>
If you wish to be a new anoncvs mirror site, please contact the anoncvs
<a href=mailto:deraadt@theos.com>maintainer</a>.
Anoncvs mirrors require about 300MB of disk, and use up to 4MB of swap
per anoncvs user (assuming the user does a large operation; while smaller
operations use fewer resources, anoncvs still makes much more of an
impact than ftp or sup).  Such anoncvs machines should have excellent
network connectivity for the area they are expected to serve.  A
<a href=anoncvs.shar>document</a>
which describes the setup of anoncvs servers is available.
