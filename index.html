<h1>OpenBSD</h1>

<p>
The OpenBSD project involves continuing development of a multiplatform
4.4BSD-based Unix-like operating system.

<h3><hr><a name=additions>Changes Relative to other *BSD's.</a></h3>

<p>
OpenBSD looks a lot like NetBSD (which it is derived from, following
the 4.4BSD roots), but is now being developed seperately.  Good changes
from other free operating systems will be merged in (of course, depending
on various factors like developer time for example.)  OpenBSD tracks
NetBSD changes very closely; say anywhere between 2 days to 10 days
behind the state of NetBSD-current all the time.  Hence you can truly
say that OpenBSD is NetBSD <b>PLUS MORE STUFF</b>.
</p>

<p>
Various additions have been made. This is only a small partial list of
the major machine independent changes (ie. it is the most interesting
changes or what people ask about most often). Check the specific port
you are interested in for further details of that port -- many of them
have been extended too.
<ul>
<li>Many many NetBSD PR's fixed (which NetBSD has not yet fixed)
<li>New curses library, including libform, libpanel and libmenu.
<li>a termlib library which understands termcap.db, needed for new curses. 
<li>The FreeBSD ports subsystem was integrated and is usable by you! 
<li>ipfilter for filtering dangerous packets
<li>better ELF support
<li>nlist() that understands ELF, ECOFF, and a.out, allowing non-a.out ports
	to use kvm utilies 
<li>Verbatim integration of the GNU tools (using a wrapper Makefile)
<li>All the pieces needed for cross compilation are in the source tree.
<li>Some LKM support in the tree.
<li>ATAPI support (should work on all ISA busses)
<li>new scsi, md5, pkg_* commands
<li>Numerous security related fixes
<li>Kerberos and other crypto in the source tree that is exportable
<li>Solid YP master, server, and client capabilities.
<li>/dev/rnd -- source of random data
<li>In-kernel update(8) with an adaptive algorithm
<li>Some ddb improvements and extensions
<li>Numerous scsi fixes
<li>new system calls: rfork(), minherit(), poll().
<li>select() that can handle any amount of file descriptors.
<li>kernfs extensions
<li>ATM support (support for one company's sparc & i386 cards available)
<li>Boot kernels with "-c" to edit/enable/disable device configuration tables
<li>pax as tar, gnutar is toast
<li>Even more security fixes.
<li>Accepts FreeBSD MD5 passwords in password maps, soon will be able of
	generating them too
<li>Linux ext2fs and BSD4.4 LFS support being worked on.
</ul>
</p>

<h3><hr><a name=curplat>Platforms currently supported.</a></h3>

<p>
Note: for some of these platforms, the platform-independent code may
be identical to that found in NetBSD because there isn't a specific
OpenBSD developer. For other ports the differences are significant.
If you find an empty page that means nothing of consequence that is
directly port-specific has changed from NetBSD. (Of course there are
differences, but they just aren't in the /sys/arch/XXXX directory).

<p>
Snapshots will be made available from time to time in the following
directories.  Please do not fetch binaries directly from
<string>cvs.openbsd.org</string>, but instead use one of these
mirrors.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href=ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots>

</p>

<p>
You should also read the <a href=snapshots.html>
general description about OpenBSD snapshots</a>.

<p>
The page for each platform (listed above) provides a link to the
specific snapshot ftp area, as well as other information you might
find neccessary or handy.

<h3><a name=devel>How we help developers and users.</a></h3>

<p>
<dl>
<dt><h4>Mailing Lists:</h4>
<dd>Some mailing lists are used for the development and use of OpenBSD.
In each case, send mail to
<a href=mailto:majordomo@OpenBSD.org>majordomo@OpenBSD.org</a>
with a message body of "<strong>subscribe mailing-list-name</strong>".

There is a only minimal set of mailing lists intentionally; among
other benefits such as more communication it reduces cross-posting.
There are no private mailing lists.
<p>
These are the mailing lists:
<dl>
<dt><strong>announce</strong>
<dd>important announcements. Since this is a low volume list
it is excellent for people who just want to follow important events.
<dt><strong>tech</strong>
<dd>technical discussions
<dt><strong>misc</strong>
<dd>user questions and answers
<dt><strong>source-changes</strong>
<dd>automated mailout of CVS source tree changes
</dl>

<p>
For further assistance, send a message body of "<strong>help</strong>",
and you will receive a reply outlining all your options.
</p>

</dl>

<dl><h4>Bug tracking:</h4>
We run GNATS for tracking bugs:
<a href=/cgi-bin/wwwgnats.pl>Click here to enter the bug tracking system.</a>

<dl><h4>FTP:</h4>
<dd>This is a list of currently known ftp servers:<p>
<ul>

</p>

<dt><h4>SUP:</h4>
<dd>Sorry, unlike other *BSD projects, the SUP service is not
available.  We do not believe the SUP service to be a good tool for
source code access. But read below for the description of the
<a href="#anoncvs"><strong>anoncvs</strong> service!</a>

<dt><h4>CVS Access:</h4>
<dd>CVS is used to manage the OpenBSD source tree. This allows
developers to work on a local source tree and commit their changes when
ready.  Also <strong>anyone</strong> can edit source files on their
local machines, and automatically track and merge in any changes made
in the OpenBSD CVS repository. Additionally they can easily see the
logs of, check out, or "diff" the source files in the OpenBSD source
tree.

<p>
The latest version of CVS is available at
<a href=ftp://ftp.cyclic.com/pub/cvs/>Cyclic</a>.
Versions earlier than 1.6 are not recommended, and may not work.
</p>

<p>
There are two levels of source tree access:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Read-write access for developers</strong>
<dd>Developers who need to commit changes to the source tree must have
an account on the OpenBSD machines.  Getting this access will be a
natural result of working on the sources with other OpenBSD developers.
</dl>
</p>
The OpenBSD cvs server is in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. 
<p>

<dl>
<a name="anoncvs">
<dt><strong>Read-only access for everyone</strong>
<dd>Anyone can access the read-only CVS repositories. These copies
of the read-write CVS repository are mirrored often. To use one,
set your <strong>CVSROOT</strong> environment variable to one of
the following values:
<ul>
<p>
<li><strong>CVSROOT=anoncvs@anoncvs.usa.openbsd.org:/cvs</strong><br>
Host also known as <strong>anoncvs.openbsd.org</strong> and
<strong>eap.ccrc.wustl.edu</strong>.<br>
located at Washington University, St. Louis, mid-west USA.<br>
maintained by <a href=mailto:chuck@maria.wustl.edu>Chuck Cranor</a>.<br>
protocols: rsh, ssh, ssh port 2022.<br>
updated every 4 hours.<br>
<p>
<li><strong>CVSROOT=anoncvs@anoncvs2.usa.openbsd.org:/cvs</strong><br>
Host also known as <strong>hal.cs.umr.edu</strong>.<br>
located at University of Missouri-Rolla, Rolla, MO, mid-west USA.<br>
maintained by <a href=mailto:johns@cs.umr.edu>John Stone</a>.<br>
protocols: ssh, ssh port 2022 (<strong>NO rsh</strong>).<br>
updated every 12 hours.<br>
<p>
<li><strong>CVSROOT=anoncvs@anoncvs.uk.openbsd.org:/cvs</strong><br>
Host also known as <strong>dumpty.wonderland.org</strong>.<br>
located in London, UK.<br>
maintained by <a href=mailto:peter@wonderland.org>Peter Galbavy</a>.<br>
protocols: rsh, ssh, ssh port 2022.<br>
updated every 12 hours.<br>
</ul>
<p>
You may want to use `traceroute' to find out which server is nearest you.
</dl>
</p>

<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong>
There are a few issues relating to cryptographic software that everyone
should be aware of:
<ul>
<li>The OpenBSD sources are from Canada.
<a href=http://insight.mcmaster.ca/org/efc/pages/doc/crypto-export.html>It
is legal to export crypto software from Canada to the world.</a>
<p>
<li>However, if you are outside the USA or Canada, you should not
fetch the cryptographic sections of the OpenBSD sources from an
anoncvs server located in the USA. The files in question are...
<ul>
<li>src/kerberosIV/*
<li>src/lib/libc/crypt/crypt.c
<li>src/lib/libc/crypt/morecrypt.c
</ul>
Because of the USA ITAR munitions list,
crypto software may only be exported to Canada from the USA.
<p>
<li><strong>At the moment most of the anoncvs servers are in the USA.
OpenBSD is looking for people willing to run an anoncvs servers in
Europe and other places in the world!</strong>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
A sample use of an anoncvs CVS server would be:
<pre>
% setenv CVSROOT anoncvs@anoncvs.usa.openbsd.org:/cvs
% cd /tmp
% cvs get sparc
[copies the files from the repository to your machine]
% cvs log sparc/sparc/locore.s
[shows the commit log for the chosen file ]
% cvs diff -bc -r1.1 -r1.5 sparc/sparc/locore.s
[shows the changes between revisions 1.1 and rev 1.5]
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The CVS man page (included with the CVS sources) has much more
information about how CVS can be used.
</p>

<p>
The anoncvs service gives fledgling developers a chance to learn CVS
operation and get thoroughly involved in the development process
before getting "commit" access -- as a result of showing useful
skills and high quality results they will naturally later be given
developer access.  As well, people providing patches can create
their "diff"s relative to the CVS tree, which will ease integration.
</p>

<p>
The CVS client uses rsh to talk to the CVS server.  If some local
security measure like a firewall (or imperfect protocol emulators
like slirp) prevents you from using rsh, you may be able to use
<a href=http://www.cs.hut.fi/ssh>ssh</a>
instead (if you are running Solaris, there is a kernel bug which
causes problems -- contact 
<a href=mailto:johns@cs.umr.edu>johns@cs.umr.edu</a>
for further details).  In this case, one sets the environment
variable <strong>CVS_RSH</strong> to point to ssh (typically
<strong>/usr/local/bin/ssh</strong>). To reduce the performance
hit the anoncvs server would take it is recommended (and requested)
that you disable encryption.  If your local site prevents you from
connecting out to port 22 (which ssh defaults to using) use port 2022.
</p>

<p>
Do not be tempted to turn on compression since CVS already compresses.
Use something like the following in your <strong>$HOME/.ssh/config</strong>
file.
</p>
<pre>
	Host anoncvs.usa.openbsd.org
	    Cipher none
	    Port 2022
</pre>

<p>
If you wish to be a new anoncvs mirror site, please contact the anoncvs
<a href=mailto:deraadt@theos.com>maintainer</a>.
Anoncvs mirrors require about 300MB of disk, and use up to 4MB of swap
per anoncvs user (assuming the user does a large operation; while smaller
operations use fewer resources, anoncvs still makes much more of an
impact than ftp or sup).  Such anoncvs machines should have excellent
network connectivity for the area they are expected to serve.  A
<a href=anoncvs.shar>document</a>
which describes the setup of anoncvs servers is available.
