<h2>3.1 - Buying an OpenBSD CD</h2>

<p>
Purchasing an OpenBSD CD is generally the best way to get started. Visit the 
ordering page to purchase your copy:
<a href= "../orders.html">OpenBSD ordering page</a>.

<p>
There are many good reasons to own an OpenBSD CD:
<ul>
  <li>CD sales support ongoing development of OpenBSD.
  <li>Development of a multi-platform operating system requires constant 
      investment in equipment.
  <li>Your support in the form of a CD purchase has a real impact on future
      development.
  <li>The CD contains binaries (and source) for all supported platforms.
  <li>The CD is bootable on several platforms, and can be used to bootstrap
      a machine without a pre-existing installed operating system.
  <li>The CD is useful for bootstrapping even if you choose to install a 
      snapshot.
  <li>Installing from CD is faster! Installing from CD preserves network
      connectivity resources.
  <li>OpenBSD CDs always come with very nice stickers. Your system isn't fully
      complete without these. You can only get these stickers by buying a CD
      set or donating hardware.
</ul>

<p>
If you're installing a release version of OpenBSD, you should use a 
CD.

<h2>3.2 - Buying OpenBSD T-Shirts</h2>
<p>
Yes, OpenBSD has t-shirts for your wearing enjoyment. You can view
these at the <a href="../tshirts.html">OpenBSD T-shirts page</a>. 
Enjoy :)

<p>
<a name= "ISO"></a>
<h2>3.3 - Does OpenBSD provide an ISO image for download?</h2>
Some other open source operating systems are commonly distributed
as CD-ROM ISO images.  This is <i>not</i> how OpenBSD is distributed. 
<p>
The OpenBSD project does not make the ISO images used to master
the official CDs available for download.  The reason is simply
that we would like you to buy the CD sets, helping fund ongoing
OpenBSD development. The official OpenBSD CD-ROM layout is copyright 
Theo de Raadt.  Theo does not permit people to redistribute images of the 
official OpenBSD CDs.  As an incentive for people to buy the CD set, some 
extras are included in the package as well (artwork, stickers etc).
<p>
Note that only the CD layout is copyrighted, OpenBSD itself is free. 
Nothing precludes someone else from downloading OpenBSD and making their
own CD. If for some reason you want to download a CD image, try
searching the mailing list archives for possible sources.
Of course, any OpenBSD ISO images available on the Internet
either violate Theo de Raadt's copyright or are not official images.
The source of an unofficial image may or may not be trustworthy;
it is up to you to determine this for yourself.
<p>
We suggest that people who want to download OpenBSD for free use
the FTP install option.
For those that need a bootable CD for their system, bootdisk ISO images
<!-- XXXrelease -->
(named <tt>cd36.iso</tt>) are available for a number of platforms which
will then permit the rest of the system to be installed via FTP.  These
ISO images are only a few megabytes in size, and contain just the installation 
tools, not the actual file sets.

<p>

<h2>3.4 - Downloading via FTP, HTTP or AFS</h2>

<p>
There are numerous international mirror sites offering FTP and HTTP access to
OpenBSD releases and snapshots. AFS access is also available. You should
always use the site nearest to you. Before you begin fetching a release
or snapshot, you may wish to use 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ping&amp;sektion=8">ping(8)</a>
and 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=traceroute&amp;sektion=8">traceroute(8)</a>
to determine which mirror site is nearest to you and whether that
mirror is performing adequately. Of course, your OpenBSD release
CD is always closer than any mirror. Access information is here:

<p>
<a href= "../ftp.html">OpenBSD FTP page</a>.

<h2>3.5 - Obtaining Current Source Code</h2>

<p>
Source to OpenBSD is freely redistributable and available at no charge.
Generally the best way to get started with a current source tree is to
install the source from the most recent CD and then configure AnonCVS to
update it regularly. Information about AnonCVS, including how to set it
up, is available here:

<p>
<a href= "../anoncvs.html">OpenBSD AnonCVS page</a>. 

<p>
or see <a href= "faq8.html#CVS">FAQ 8, CVS</a>

<p>
If you don't have sufficient network bandwidth to support AnonCVS, or if
your Internet access is via UUCP, you can still keep your source current
by using CTM instead of AnonCVS. If that's your situation, then starting
with a recent release CD is even more important. Information about CTM,
including how to set it up, is available here:

<p>
<a href= "../ctm.html">OpenBSD CTM page</a>.

<p>
Yet another alternative is to get the source code from the web. You can
do that through cvsweb at: 

<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/">http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/</a>.
