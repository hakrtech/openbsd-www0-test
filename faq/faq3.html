<h2>3.1 - Buying an OpenBSD CD</h2>
<p>
Purchasing an OpenBSD CD is generally the best way to get started. Visit the ordering page to purchase your copy:
<a href="../orders.html">http://www.openbsd.org/orders.html</a>.

<p>
There are many good reasons to own an OpenBSD CD: <br>
<ul>
<li>CD sales support on-going development of OpenBSD. 
<li>Development of a multi-platform operating system requires constant investment in equipment. 
<li>Your support in the form of a CD purchase has a real impact on future development. 
<li>The CD contains binaries (and source) for all supported platforms. 
<li>The CD is bootable on several platforms, and can be used to bootstrap a machine without a pre-existing installed operating
system.
<li>The CD is useful for bootstrapping even if you choose to install a snapshot. 
<li>Installing from CD is faster! Installing from CD preserves network connectivity resources. 
</ul>
<p>
If you're installing a release version of OpenBSD, you should use a CD. Snapshot releases can only be installed over the
network.

<h2>3.2 - Downloading via FTP or AFS </h2>
<p>
There are numerous international mirror sites offering FTP access to OpenBSD releases and snapshots. AFS access is also
available. You should always use the site closest to you. Before you begin fetching a release or snapshot, you may wish to use
ping and traceroute to determine which mirror site is nearest to you and whether that nearest mirror is performing adequately.
Of course, your OpenBSD release CD is always closer than any mirror. Access information is here:

<h2>3.3 - Obtaining Current Source Code </h2>
<p>
Source to OpenBSD is freely redistributable and available at no charge. Generally the best way to get started with a current
source tree is to install the source from the most recent CD and then configure AnonCVS to update it regularly. Information
about AnonCVS, including how to set it up, is available here: <br>
<p>
<a href="../anoncvs.html">http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html</a>. 
<br>
or check <a href="faq8.html#8.5"> The OpenBSD FAQ </a><p>
If you don't have sufficient network bandwidth to support AnonCVS, or if your Internet access is via UUCP, you can still keep
your source current by using CTM instead of AnonCVS. If that's your situation, then starting with a recent release CD is even
more important. Information about CTM, including how to set it up, is available here: <br>
