<h2>3.1 - Buying an OpenBSD CD</h2>
</p>

<p>
Purchasing an OpenBSD CD is generally the best way to get started. Visit the 
ordering page to purchase your copy:
<a href= "../orders.html">http://www.openbsd.org/orders.html</a>.
</p>

<p>
There are many good reasons to own an OpenBSD CD:
<ul>
    <li>CD sales support on-going development of OpenBSD.</li> 
    <li>Development of a multi-platform operating system requires constant 
        investment in equipment.</li> 
    <li>Your support in the form of a CD purchase has a real impact on future
        development.</li> 
    <li>The CD contains binaries (and source) for all supported platforms.</li> 
    <li>The CD is bootable on several platforms, and can be used to bootstrap
        a machine without a pre-existing installed operating system.</li>
    <li>The CD is useful for bootstrapping even if you choose to install a 
        snapshot.</li> 
    <li>Installing from CD is faster! Installing from CD preserves network
        connectivity resources.</li> 
    <li>OpenBSD CD's always come with very nice stickers. You system isn't fully
        complete without these. You can only get these stickers by buying a CD
        set or donating hardware.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If you're installing a release version of OpenBSD, you should use a CD. Snapshot
releases can only be installed over the network.

<h2>3.1.1 - Buying OpenBSD T-Shirts</h2>
</p>
<p>
Yes, OpenBSD now has t-shirts for your wearing enjoyment. You can view
these at <a href="../tshirts.html">http://www.OpenBSD.org/tshirts.html</a>. 
Enjoy :)

<h2>3.2 - Downloading via FTP or AFS</h2>
</p>

<p>
There are numerous international mirror sites offering FTP access to OpenBSD 
releases and snapshots. AFS access is also available. You should always use
the site closest to you. Before you begin fetching a release or snapshot, you 
may wish to use ping and traceroute to determine which mirror site is nearest
to you and whether that nearest mirror is performing adequately. Of course, 
your OpenBSD release CD is always closer than any mirror. Access information is
here:

<h2>3.3 - Obtaining Current Source Code</h2>
</p>

<p>
Source to OpenBSD is freely redistributable and available at no charge.
Generally the best way to get started with a current source tree is to install
the source from the most recent CD and then configure AnonCVS to update it
regularly. Information about AnonCVS, including how to set it up, is available
here:
</p>

<p>
<a href= "../anoncvs.html">http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html</a>. 
</p>

<p>
or check <a href= "faq8.html#8.5">The OpenBSD FAQ</a>
</p>

<p>
If you don't have sufficient network bandwidth to support AnonCVS, or if your
Internet access is via UUCP, you can still keep your source current by using
CTM instead of AnonCVS. If that's your situation, then starting with a recent
release CD is even more important. Information about CTM, including how to set
it up, is available here:
</p>

<p>
<a href= "../ctm.html">http://www.openbsd.org/ctm.html</a>.
</p>

<p>
Yet another alternative is to get the source code from the web. You can do that thru cvsweb at:
