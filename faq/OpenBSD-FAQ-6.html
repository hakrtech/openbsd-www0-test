<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Why can't I use my old linux ifconfig commands and flags?</A></H2>

<P>Linux's implementations of "ifconfig" and "route" are not
standard.  OpenBSD's versions are normal. To get my ne2000
clone working, I type:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
corinne# ifconfig ed2 205.212.82.80 up
corinne# route add default 205.212.82.1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>That should work to get ANY ethernet interface working,
as long as you specify the correct IP numbers and interface.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Whenever I do anything to the network I get a "device</A>timeout" error!?!</H2>

<P>This is because you have an incorrect hardware or irq address
assigned to your ethernet interface. To fix this, reboot the
machine with the "<CODE>-c</CODE>" flag and change the attributes for
your ethernet interface. See the general instructions in 
<A HREF="OpenBSD-FAQ-1.html#non-std-hw">section 1</A> of this FAQ on how to change
how the kernel talks to your hardware.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Hey, my IP Aliasing breaks after trying to add a</A>third host!</H2>

<P>Aliasing one additional host usually isn't a big deal. When a
user tries to alias a third or fourth host, sometimes things
break. Adding "<CODE>netmask 0xffffffff</CODE>" to the end of your
"<CODE>ifconfig</CODE>" for adding the aliased host solves the
problem. i.e.:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
sparcy# ifconfig le0 alias 123.45.67.89 netmask 0xffffffff
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 How do I view the hosts that I've aliased?</A></H2>

<P>If you are using the 2.1 release, you must use netstat
to see what IP numbers you have added to your interface. In
"current" (post 1997-June-17) source, "<CODE>ifconfig -a</CODE>"
will show your aliases.</P>
