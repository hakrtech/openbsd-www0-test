<a name= "Linux"></a><h2 id="Introduction">Tips for users of other
Unix-like operating systems</h2>

If you learned Unix from any of the <a href="../books.html">good books</a>
on general Unix, understanding the Unix philosophy and then extending your
knowledge to a particular platform, you will find OpenBSD to be familiar.

<p>
One important difference between OpenBSD and many other operating systems
is the documentation.
OpenBSD developers take great pride in the system
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org">man pages</a>.
The man pages are <i>the</i> authoritative OpenBSD documentation.
Developers making a change to the system are expected to update the man pages
along with their change to the system code.
It is expected that a user will check the man pages before asking for help on
the <a href="../mail.html">mailing lists</a>.

<p>
Here are some of the commonly encountered differences between OpenBSD and other
Unix variants.

<ul>
  <li>OpenBSD is a BSD-style Unix, following the 4.4BSD design closely.
      Linux and Solaris are System V style systems.
      Some Unix-like operating systems mix System V and BSD characteristics.
      A common place where this causes confusion is the
      <a href="faq10.html#rc">startup scripts</a>.
      OpenBSD uses the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rc">rc(8)</a> system.

  <li>OpenBSD is a complete system, intended to be kept in sync.
      It is not a kernel plus utilities that can be upgraded separately from
      each other.

  <li>OpenBSD maintains a <a href="faq15.html#Ports">ports tree</a> to provide
      third party software.
      Pre-compiled <a href="faq15.html#PkgMgmt">packages</a> are created and
      distributed by the OpenBSD ports team.

  <li>OpenBSD uses CVS to keep track of source code changes.
      OpenBSD pioneered <a href="../anoncvs.html">anonymous CVS</a>, which
      allows anyone to extract the full source tree for any version of OpenBSD
      at any time.
      There also is a <a href="http://cvsweb.openbsd.org">web interface</a>.

  <li>OpenBSD produces an official release available via
      <a href="../orders.html">CD</a> and <a href="../ftp.html">HTTP</a> every
      six months on a <a href="faq1.html#Next">predefined schedule</a>.
      <a href="faq4.html#Snapshots">Snapshots</a> for all supported platforms
      are made semi-regularly with the current development code.

  <li>OpenBSD has gone through heavy and continual security auditing to ensure
      the quality and security of the code.

  <li>The names of hard disks are usually <tt>/dev/wd</tt> (SATA/IDE) and
      <tt>/dev/sd</tt> (SCSI-like disks, such as USB drives).

  <li>OpenBSD does not support journaling filesystems.
      Instead we use the <a href="faq14.html#SoftUpdates">soft updates</a>
      feature of the Fast File System (FFS).

  <li>OpenBSD comes with <a href="pf/index.html">Packet Filter (PF)</a>.
      This means that Network Address Translation, queuing, and filtering are
      handled through <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/pfctl">pfctl(8)</a>,
      <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/pf">pf(4)</a> and
      <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf">pf.conf(5)</a>.

  <li>OpenBSD's default shell is
      <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ksh">ksh(1)</a>, which is based on the
      <a href="http://web.cs.mun.ca/~michael/pdksh/">public domain Korn
      shell</a>.
      Shells such as bash and many others can be added from
      <a href="faq15.html#PkgMgmt">packages</a> or <a href="faq15.html#Ports">
      ports</a>.

  <li>Devices are named by driver, not by type.
      In other words, there are no <tt>eth0</tt> and <tt>eth1</tt> devices.
      It would be <tt>em0</tt> for an Intel PRO/1000 Ethernet card,
      <tt>bge0</tt> for a Broadcom BCM57xx or BCM590x Ethernet device,
      <tt>ral0</tt> for a RaLink wireless device, etc.

  <li>OpenBSD/i386, amd64, and several other platforms use a two layer disk
      partitioning system, where the first layer is the
      <a href="faq14.html#fdisk">fdisk</a> BIOS-visible partition.
      The second layer is the <a href="faq14.html#disklabel">disklabel</a>, a
      traditional BSD partitioning system.

  <li>Some other OSs encourage you to customize your kernel for your machine.
      OpenBSD users are encouraged to simply use the standard GENERIC kernel
      provided and tested by the developers.

  <li>OpenBSD works hard to maintain the
      <a href="../policy.html">license policy</a> and
      <a href="../security.html">security</a> of the project.
      For this reason, some newer versions of some software which fail to meet
      either the license or security goals of the project have not been
      integrated into OpenBSD.
</ul>

<h2 id="passwd">Converting your Linux (or other Sixth Edition-style)
password file to BSD-style</h2>

First, figure out if your Linux password file is shadowed or not.
If it is, install <a href="http://www.openwall.com/john/">John the Ripper</a>
from <a href="faq15.html">packages or ports</a> (<tt>security/john</tt>) and
use the "unshadow" utility that comes with it to merge your <tt>passwd</tt>
and <tt>shadow</tt> files into one Sixth Edition-style file.

<p>
Using your Linux password file, we'll call it <tt>linux_passwd</tt>, you
need to add in ::0:0 between fields four and seven.
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/awk">awk(1)</a>
does this for you.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>awk -F : '{printf("%s:%s:%s:%s::0:0:%s:%s:%s\n", \</b>
> <b>$1,$2,$3,$4,$5,$6,$7); }' linux_passwd > new_passwd</b>
</pre></blockquote>

At this point, you want to edit the <tt>new_passwd</tt> file and remove
the root and other system entries that are already present in your
OpenBSD password file or aren't applicable with OpenBSD (all of them).
Also, make sure there are no duplicate usernames or user IDs between
<tt>new_passwd</tt> and your OpenBSD box's <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>.
The easiest way to do this is to start with a fresh <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cat new_passwd >> /etc/master.passwd</b>
# <b>pwd_mkdb -p /etc/master.passwd</b>
</pre></blockquote>

The last step, <tt>pwd_mkdb</tt> is necessary to rebuild the
<tt>/etc/spwd.db</tt> and <tt>/etc/pwd.db</tt> files.
It also creates a Sixth Edition-style password file (minus encrypted passwords)
at <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> for programs which use it.
OpenBSD uses a stronger encryption for passwords, blowfish, which is very
unlikely to be found on any system which uses full Sixth Edition-style
password files.
To switch over to this stronger encryption, simply have the users run
<tt>passwd</tt> and change their password.
The new password they enter will be encrypted with your default setting
(usually blowfish unless you've edited <tt>/etc/login.conf</tt>).
Or, as root, you can run <tt>passwd <i>username</i></tt>.

<h2 id="Ext2FS">Accessing your Linux files from OpenBSD</h2>

OpenBSD supports the EXT2 file system for read/write, and can read EXT4.
