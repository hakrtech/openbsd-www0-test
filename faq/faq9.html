<h1> 9.0 - Migrating from Linux </h1>
<P>
If you are migrating from Linux to OpenBSD, note that OpenBSD
has COMPAT_LINUX enabled by default in the GENERIC kernel.
To run any Linux binaries that are not statically linked (most of them),
you need to follow the instructions on the <A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=compat_linux&sektion=8&format=html">compat_linux(8)</a> manual page.
A simple way to get most of the useful Linux libraries is to install
linux_lib from your ports collection.
<ul>
<pre>
# <strong>cd /usr/ports/emulators/linux_lib</strong>
# <strong>make install</strong>
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
OpenBSD supports the EXT2FS file system.  You must recompile your kernel
with option EXT2FS in order to get this support.  Once you have it,
you can mount your Linux partitions.  Use disklabel <i>disk</i> to see what
OpenBSD thinks your Linux partition is (but <strong>don't</strong> use disklabel
or fdisk to make any changes to it).

<h2>9.1 - Simple tips for Linux (and other free Unix-like OS) users</h2>
</p>

<p>
There are several differences between OpenBSD and Linux. These differences
include but are not limited to, bootup procedure, network interface usage and 
disk management. Most differences are well documented, but involve searching 
manpages. This document tries to be an index of those differences.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
    <li>OpenBSD has a ports tree. This is to accomodate the fact that at this
        point not many applications are native to the OpenBSD environment.
        This is both an attempt to get applications to work on OpenBSD for
        end-users and to get more applications made with OpenBSD in mind. 
        Eventually this ports tree will be used to make a nice set of binary
        packages.</li>
    <li>OpenBSD uses CVS for source changes.  With Linux, source code
        is disseminated
        through separate distributions.  OpenBSD has pioneered anonymous
        CVS, which allows
        anyone to extract the full source tree for any version of OpenBSD
        (from 2.0 to current, and all revisions of all files in between)
        at any time! There is also a very convenient and easy to use <A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/">web interface to CVS</a>.
	<li>OpenBSD
        periodically releases snapshots for various architectures and makes
        a stable, official CD release every 6 months.</li>
    <li>OpenBSD contains STRONG CRYPTO, which USA based OS's can't contain.
        (See <a href= "../crypto.html">http://www.openbsd.org/crypto.html</a>)
        OpenBSD has also gone through heavy security auditing and many security
        features have already been implemented into the source tree. (IPSEC,
        KERBEROS).</li>
    <li>OpenBSD's kernel is /bsd.</li>
    <li>The names of hard disks are usually /dev/wd and /dev/sd (ATA/SCSI)</li>
    <li>/sbin/ifconfig with no arguments in Linux gives the state of all the
        interfaces. Under OpenBSD you need the -a flag.</li>
    <li>/sbin/route with no arguments in Linux gives the state of all the
        active routes. Under OpenBSD you need the "show" parameter, or do a 
        netstat -r (nice).</li>
    <li>OpenBSD comes with Darren Reed's IP Filter package, not ipfw.  This means that:
<ul>
    <li>IP-Masquerading is done through ipnat. 
        (<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ipnat&apropos=0&sektion=1&format=html">ipnat(1)</a>)</li>
    <li>ipfwadm is done through ipf 
        (<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ipf&apropos=0&sektion=1&format=html">ipf(1)</a>, 
         <a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ipnat&apropos=0&sektion=5&format=html">ipf(5)</a>)</li>
     <li>You should look at <A HREF="faq6.html">section 6</a> for detailed configuration assistance and information.
</ul>
    <li>Interface address is stored in /etc/hostname.&lt;interfacename&gt;. It can
        be a name instead of an IP address.</li>
    <li>The machine name is in /etc/myname</li>
    <li>The default gateway is in /etc/mygate</li>
    <li>The network interface aliases are in /etc/ifaliases
    <li>OpenBSD's default shell is /bin/sh, which is the Korn shell. Shells such as bash and tcsh can be
        added as packages or installed from the ports tree.</li>
    <li>Password management changes a lot. The main files are different. 
        (<a href=" http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=passwd&apropos=0&sektion=1&format=html">passwd(1)</a>,
         <a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=passwd&apropos=0&sektion=5&format=html">passwd(5)</a>)</li>
</ul>
