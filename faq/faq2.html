<h2> 2.2 - Mailing Lists </h2>
<p>
The OpenBSD project maintains several popular mailing lists which users should subscribe to and follow. To subscribe
     to a mailing list, send an e-mail message to <a href="mailto:majordomo@openbsd.org">majordomo@openbsd.org</a>. That address is an automated subscription
     service. In the body of your message, on a single line, you should include a subscribe command for the list you wish to
join. For example:<br>
<p>
<strong>subscribe announce</strong>
<p>
The list processor will reply to you, asking for confirmation of your intent to join the list. The confirmation you send back
     to the list processor will be included in its reply to you. It will look something like this: <br>
<p>
<strong>auth 90855167 subscribe announce you@example.com</strong> 
<p>
Once you have confirmed your intent to join, you will be immediately added to the list, and the list processor will notify
     you that you were successfully added. <p>
To <strong>unsubscribe</strong> from a list, you will again send an e-mail message to <a href="mailto:majordomo@openbsd.org"> majordomo@openbsd.org</a>. It might look like this:<br>
<p>
<strong>unsubscribe announce </strong>
<p>
If you have any difficulties with the mailing list system, please first read the instructions. They can be obtained by sending
     an e-mail message to <a href="mailto:majordomo@openbsd.org">majordomo@openbsd.org</a> with a message body of help. These are the currently-available
     OpenBSD mailing lists:<br>
<p>
<ul>

<h2> 2.3 - Manual Pages </h2>
<p>
OpenBSD comes with extensive documentation in the form of manual pages, as well as longer documents relating to
     specific applications. To access the manual pages and other documentation, be sure that you installed the man, misc, and
     text distributions. 
<p>
Here is a list of some of the most useful manual pages for new users: <br>
<ul>
<li><strong>afterboot(8)</strong> - things to check after the first complete boot 
<li> <strong>boot(8)</strong> - system bootstrapping procedures 
<li> <strong>passwd.conf(5)</strong> - format of the password configuration file 
<li><strong>adduser_proc(8)</strong> - procedure for adding new users 
<li><strong>adduser(8)</strong> - command for adding new users  
<li><strong>vipw(8)</strong> - edit the password file
<li><strong>man(1)</strong> - display the on-line manual pages 
<li><strong>sendbug(1)</strong> - send problem report (PR) about OpenBSD to a central support site 
<li><strong>disklabel(8)</strong> - read and write disk pack label 
<li><strong>ifconfig(8)</strong> - configure network interface parameters 
<li> <strong>route(8)</strong> - manually manipulate the routing tables. 
<li> <strong>netstat(1)</strong> - show network status reboot. 
<li><strong>halt(8)</strong> - stopping and restarting the system 
<li><strong>shutdown(8)</strong> - close down the system at a given time 
<li><strong>boot_config(8)</strong> -  how to change kernel configuration at boot 
</ul>
<p>
In general, if you know the name of a command or a manual page, you can read it by executing <strong>`man command'</strong>. For
     example: <strong>`man vi'</strong> to read about the vi editor. If you don't know the name of the command, or if <strong>`man command'</strong> doesn't

     find the manual page, you can search the manual page database by executing <strong>`apropos something'</strong> or <strong>`man -k something'</strong>
where something is a likely word that might appear in the title of the manual page you're looking for. For example:<br>
<p>
<strong>
bsd# apropos "time zone" <br>
tzfile (5) - time zone information <br>
zdump (8) - time zone dumper<br>
zic (8) - time zone compiler <br>
</strong>
<p>
The parenthetical numbers indicate the section of the manual in which that page can be
     found. In some cases, you may find manual pages with identical names living in separate sections of the manual. For
     example, assume that you want to know the format of the configuration files for the cron daemon. Once you know the
     section of the manual for the page you want, you would execute <strong>`man n command'</strong> where n is the manual section
     number. 
<p>
<strong> 
bsd# man -k cron<br> 
cron (8) - daemon to execute scheduled commands (Vixie Cron)<br>
crontab (1) - maintain crontab files for individual users (V3) <br>
crontab (5) - tables for driving cron <br>
bsd# man 5 crontab <br>
</strong>
<p>
In addition to the UNIX manual pages, there is a typesettable document set (included in the misc distribution). It lives in
     the /usr/share/doc directory. If you also installed the text distribution, then you can format each document set with a
     `make' in the appropriate subdirectory. The psd subdirectory is the Programmer's Supplementary Documents
     distribution. The smm subdirectory is the System Manager's Manual. The usd subdirectory is the UNIX User's
     Supplementary Documents distribution. You can perform your `make' in the three distribution subdirectories, or you can
     select a specific section of a distribution and do a `make' in its subdirectory. Some of the subdirectories are empty. By
     default, formatting the documents will result in Postscript output, suitable for printing. The Postscript output can be quite
     large -- you should assume 250-300% increase in volume. If you do not have access to a Postscript printer or display,
     you may also format the documents for reading on a terminal display. In each Makefile you'll need to add the flag -Tascii
     to each instance of the groff commands (or execute it by hand). Some of the documents use the ms formatting macros,
     and some use the me macros. The Makefile in each document subdirectory (eg, /usr/share/doc/usd/04.csh/Makefile) will
     tell you which one to use. For example:<br>
<p>

<strong>
bsd# cd /usr/share/doc/usd/04.csh <br>
bsd# groff -Tascii -ms tabs csh.1 csh.2 csh.3 csh.4 csh.a csh.g > csh.txt 
<br>
bsd# more csh.txt <br>
</strong>
<p>
The UNIX manual pages are generally more current and trustworthy than the typesettable documents. The typesettable
     documents sometimes explain complicated applications in more detail than the manual pages do.

<h2>2.4 - Reporting Bugs </h2>
<p>
Proper bug reporting is one of the most important responsibilities of end users. Very detailed information is required to
     diagnose most serious bugs. Developers frequently get bugs reports via e-mail such as these:<br>
<p>
<strong>
From: joeuser@example.com <br>
To: bugs@openbsd.org <br>
Subject: HELP!!! <br>
<p>
I have a PC and it won't boot!!!!! It's a 486!!!!!
<p>
</strong>
Hopefully most people understand why such reports get summarily deleted. All bug reports should contain detailed
     information. If Joe User had really wanted his bug investigated, his bug report would have looked something like this:<br>
<p>
<strong>
From: smartuser@example.com <br>
To: bugs@openbsd.org <br>
Subject: 2.4 panics on an i386 <br>
<p>
After installing OpenBSD 2.4 from the CD which I purchased via your outstanding on-line ordering system, I find that
     the system halts before the kernel even gets loaded. After booting with a bootdisk and escaping to a shell. This is the dmesg output:<br>

If Joe User had a working OpenBSD system from which he wanted to submit a bug report, he would have used the
     sendbug(1) utility to submit his bug report to the GNATS problem tracking system. Obviously you can't use sendbug(1)
     when your system won't boot, but you should use it whenever possible. You will still need to include detailed information
     about what happened, the exact configuration of your system, and how to reproduce the problem. The sendbug(1)
     command requires that your system be able to deliver electronic mail successfully on the Internet. 
<p>
If you have submitted a bug report and you want to check its current status without annoying anyone, the best ways are: <br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Visit the GNATS tracking system: <a href="http://cvs.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/wwwgnats.pl">http://cvs.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/wwwgnats.pl</a>.
<li>Look in the <a href="mailto:bugs@openbsd.org">bugs@openbsd.org</a> list archives: <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/mail.html">http://www.openbsd.org/mail.html</a>.
