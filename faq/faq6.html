<h2>6.1 - Before we go any further</h2>

<p>
For the bulk of this document, it helps if you have read and
at least partially understood the <a href="faq5.html">Kernel
Configuration and Setup</a> section of the FAQ, and the
<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ifconfig&amp;sektion=8">
ifconfig(8)</a> and
<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=netstat&amp;sektion=1">
netstat(1)</a> man pages.

<p>
If you are a network administrator, and you are setting up routing
protocols, if you are using your OpenBSD box as a router, if you need to
go in depth into IP networking, you really need to read
<a href="http://www.3com.com/other/pdfs/infra/corpinfo/en_US/501302.pdf">Understanding
IP Addressing</a>.
This is an excellent document.  "Understanding IP Addressing" contains
fundamental knowledge to build upon when working with IP networks,
especially when you deal with or are responsible for more than one
network.

<p>
If you are working with applications such as web servers, ftp servers,
and mail servers, you may benefit greatly by
<a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc.html">reading the RFCs</a>.
Most likely, you can't read all of them.  Pick some topics that you are
interested in, or that you use in your network environment.  Look them
up, find out how they are intended to work.  The RFCs define many
(thousands of) standards for protocols on the Internet and how they are
supposed to work.

<h2>6.2 - Initial Network Setup</h2>

<p>
<a name="Setup.1"></a>
<h3>6.2.1 - Identifying and Setting Up Your Network Interfaces</h3>

<p>
To start off, you must first identify your network interface.  In
OpenBSD, interfaces are named for the type of card, not for the type of
connection. You can see your network card get initialized during the
booting process, or after the booting process using the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dmesg&amp;sektion=8">dmesg(8)</a>
command.  You also have the chance of seeing your network interface
using the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ifconfig&amp;sektion=8">ifconfig(8)</a> command.
For example, here is the output of dmesg for a Intel Fast Ethernet
network card, which uses the device name fxp.

<blockquote><pre>
fxp0 at pci0 dev 10 function 0 "Intel 82557" rev 0x0c: irq 5, address 00:02:b3:2b:10:f7
inphy0 at fxp0 phy 1: i82555 10/100 media interface, rev. 4
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you don't know what your device name is, please look at the
<a href="../plat.html">supported hardware list</a> for your platform.
You will find a list of many common card names and their OpenBSD device
names here.  Combine the short alphabetical device name (such as fxp)
with a number assigned by the kernel and you have an interface name
(such as fxp0).

<p>
You can find out what network interfaces have been identified by using the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ifconfig&amp;sektion=8">ifconfig(8)</a>
utility. The following command will show all network interfaces on a
system.  This sample output shows us only one physical ethernet interface,
an <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fxp&amp;sektion=4">fxp(4)</a>.

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
As you can see here, 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ifconfig&amp;sektion=8">ifconfig(8)</a> 
gives us a lot more information than we need at this point. But, it
still allows us to see our interface. In the above example, the
interface card is already configured. This is obvious because an IP
network is already configured on fxp0, hence the values &quot;inet
10.0.0.38 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.0.0.255&quot;.  Also, the
<strong>UP</strong> and <strong>RUNNING</strong> flags are set.

<p>
Finally, you will notice several other interfaces come enabled by
default.  These are virtual interfaces that serve various functions.
The following manual pages describe them:

</ul>

<p>
If you don't have your interface configured, the first step is to create
the <i>/etc/hostname.xxx</i> file, where the name of your interface will
take the place of xxx. From the information in the examples above, the
name would be <i>/etc/hostname.fxp0</i>. The layout of this file is
simple:<br>

<blockquote><pre>
address_family address netmask broadcast [other options]
</pre></blockquote>

(Much more detail about the format of this file can be found in the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=hostname.if&amp;sektion=5">hostname.if(5)</a>
man page.)

<p>
A typical interface configuration file, configured for an IPv4 address,
would look like this:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <strong>cat /etc/hostname.fxp0</strong>
inet 10.0.0.38 255.255.255.0 NONE
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
You could also specify media types for Ethernet, say, if you wanted to
force 100baseTX full-duplex mode.

<blockquote><pre>
inet 10.0.0.38 255.255.255.0 NONE media 100baseTX mediaopt full-duplex
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
(Of course, you should never force full duplex mode unless both sides of
the connection are set to do this! In the absence of special needs,
media settings should be excluded.)

<p>
Or, you may want to use special flags specific to a certain interface.
The format of the hostname file doesn't change much!

<blockquote><pre>
$ <strong>cat /etc/hostname.vlan0</strong>
inet 172.21.0.31 255.255.255.0 NONE vlan 2 vlandev fxp1
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The next step from here is to setup your default gateway. To do this,
simply put the IP of your gateway in the file <i>/etc/mygate</i>. This
will allow for your gateway to be set upon boot. From here you should
setup your nameservers, and your <i>/etc/hosts</i> file (see the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=hosts&amp;sektion=5">hosts(5)</a>
man page). To setup your nameservers, you will create a file called
<i>/etc/resolv.conf</i>. You can read more about the format of this file
in the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=resolv.conf&amp;sektion=5">resolv.conf(5)</a>
man page. But for a standard usage, here is an example. In this example
your domain servers are 125.2.3.4 and 125.2.3.5. You also belong in the
domain &quot;example.com&quot;.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <strong>cat /etc/resolv.conf</strong>
search example.com
nameserver 125.2.3.4
nameserver 125.2.3.5
lookup file bind
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
From here, you can either reboot or run the
<strong>/etc/netstart</strong> script. You can do this by simply typing
(as root):

<blockquote><pre>
# <strong>sh /etc/netstart</strong>
writing to routing socket: File exists
add net 127: gateway 127.0.0.1: File exists
writing to routing socket: File exists
add net 224.0.0.0: gateway 127.0.0.1: File exists
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Notice that a few errors were produced.  By running this script, you are
reconfiguring things which are already configured.  As such, some routes
already exist in the kernel routing table.  From here your system should
be up and running. Again, you can check to make sure that your interface
was setup correctly with
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ifconfig&amp;sektion=8">ifconfig(8)</a>.
You can also check your routes via
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=netstat&amp;sektion=1">netstat(1)</a>
or <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=route&amp;sektion=8">route(8)</a>.
If you are having routing problems, you may want to use the -n flag to
route(8) which prints the IP addresses rather than doing a DNS lookup
and displaying the hostname.  Here is an example of viewing your routing
tables using both programs.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <strong>netstat -rn</strong>

<h3>6.2.2 - Setting up your OpenBSD box as a Gateway</h3>

<p>
This is the basic information you need to set up your OpenBSD box as a
gateway (also called a router). If you are using OpenBSD as a router on
the Internet, we suggest that you also read the Packet Filter setup
instructions below to block potentially malicious traffic. Also, due to
the low availability of
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ip&amp;sektion=4">IPv4</a>
addresses from network service providers and regional registries, you
may want to look at Network Address Translation for information on
conserving your IP address space.

<p>
The GENERIC kernel already has the ability to allow IP Forwarding, but
needs to be turned on. You should do this using the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sysctl&amp;sektion=8">sysctl(8)</a>
utility. To change this permanently you should edit the file 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sysctl.conf&amp;sektion=5">/etc/sysctl.conf</a>
to allow for IP Forwarding. To do so add this line in that configuration
file.

<blockquote><pre>
net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
To make this change without rebooting you would use the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sysctl&amp;sektion=8">sysctl(8)</a>
utility directly. Remember though that this change will no longer exist
after a reboot, and needs to be run as root.

<blockquote><pre>
# <strong>sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1</strong>
net.inet.ip.forwarding: 0 -&gt; 1
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Now modify the routes on the other hosts on both sides.  There are many
possible uses of OpenBSD as a router by using software such as
OpenBSD's own <a href="http://www.openbgpd.org/">OpenBGPD</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=routed&amp;sektion=8">routed(8)</a>,
<a href="http://www.mrtd.net">mrtd</a>,
<a href="http://www.zebra.org">zebra</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.quagga.net">quagga</a>. 
OpenBSD has support in the ports collection for zebra, quagga, and mrtd.
OpenBGPD and routed are installed as part of the base system.
OpenBSD supports
several T1, HSSI, ATM, FDDI, Ethernet, and serial (PPP/SLIP) interfaces.

<p>
<a name="Setup.3"></a>
<h3>6.2.3 - Setting up aliases on an interface</h3>

<p>
OpenBSD has a simple mechanism for setting up IP aliases on an
interface. To do this simply edit the file
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=hostname.if&amp;sektion=5"><i>/etc/hostname.&lt;if&gt;</i></a>.
This file is read upon boot by the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=netstart&amp;sektion=8">/etc/netstart(8)</a>
script, which is part of the <a href="faq10.html#rc">rc startup
hierarchy</a>.  For the example, we assume that the user has an
interface <b>dc0</b> and is on the network 192.168.0.0. Other important
information:

<ul>
<li>IP for dc0 is 192.168.0.2
<li>NETMASK is 255.255.255.0
</ul>

<p>
A few side notes about aliases. In OpenBSD you use the interface name
only. There is no difference between the first alias and the second
alias. Unlike some other operating systems, OpenBSD doesn't refer to
them as dc0:0, dc0:1.  If you are referring to a specific aliased IP
address with ifconfig, or adding an alias, be sure to say "<tt>ifconfig
int alias</tt>" instead of just "<tt>ifconfig int</tt>" at the command
line.  You can delete aliases with "<tt>ifconfig int delete</tt>".

<p>
Assuming you are using multiple IP addresses which are in the same IP
subnet with aliases, your netmask setting for each alias becomes
255.255.255.255.  They do not need to follow the netmask of the first IP
bound to the interface.  In this example, <i>/etc/hostname.dc0</i>, two
aliases are added to the device dc0, which, by the way, was configured
as 192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cat /etc/hostname.dc0</b>
inet 192.168.0.2 255.255.255.0 media 100baseTX
inet alias 192.168.0.3 255.255.255.255
inet alias 192.168.0.4 255.255.255.255
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Once you've made this file, it just takes a reboot for it to take
effect. You can, however, bring up the aliases by hand using the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ifconfig&amp;sektion=8">ifconfig(8)</a>
utility. To bring up the first alias you would use the command:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>ifconfig dc0 inet alias 192.168.0.3 netmask 255.255.255.255</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
To view these aliases you must use the command:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>ifconfig -A</b>
dc0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,NOTRAILERS,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt;
        media: Ethernet manual
        inet 192.168.0.2  netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.0.255
        inet 192.168.0.3 netmask 0xffffffff broadcast 192.168.0.3
</pre></blockquote>

<a name="NAT"></a>
<a name="PF"></a>
<h2>6.3 - How do I filter and firewall with OpenBSD?</h2>
Packet Filter (from here on referred to as PF) is OpenBSD's system for
filtering TCP/IP traffic and doing Network Address Translation. PF is
also capable of normalizing and conditioning TCP/IP traffic and
providing bandwidth control and packet prioritization, and can be used
to create powerful and flexible firewalls.
It is described in the <a href="pf/index.html"><b>PF User's
Guide</b></a>.


<p> 
<a name= "DHCP"></a>
<h2>6.4 - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</h2> 

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is a way to configure network
interfaces "automatically".
OpenBSD can be a DHCP server (configuring other machines), a DHCP client
(configured by another machine), and in some cases, can be both.

<p>
<h3>6.4.1 DHCP Client</h3>

<p>
To use the DHCP client
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dhclient&amp;sektion=8">dhclient(8)</a>
included with OpenBSD, edit <tt>/etc/hostname.xl0</tt> (this is assuming your
main ethernet interface is xl0.  Yours might be ep0 or fxp0 or something
else!) All you need to put in this hostname file is '<tt>dhcp</tt>':

<pre>
# <strong>echo dhcp &gt;/etc/hostname.xl0</strong>
</pre>

<p>
This will cause OpenBSD to automatically start the DHCP client on boot.
OpenBSD will gather its IP address, default gateway, and DNS servers
from the DHCP server.

<p>
If you want to start a dhcp client from the command line, make sure
<tt>/etc/dhclient.conf</tt> exists, then try:

<pre>
# <strong>dhclient fxp0</strong>
</pre>

<p>
Where <tt>fxp0</tt> is the interface that you want to receive dhcp on.

<p>
No matter how you start the dhclient, you can edit the
<tt>/etc/dhclient.conf</tt> file to <b>not</b> update your DNS according to the
dhcp server's idea of DNS by first uncommenting the 'request' lines in
it (they are examples of the default settings, but you need to uncomment
them to override dhclient's defaults.)

<pre>
request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,
      domain-name, domain-name-servers, host-name, lpr-servers, ntp-servers;
</pre>

<p>
and then <b>remove</b> domain-name-servers.  Of course, you may want to
remove hostname, or other settings too.

<p>
<h3>6.4.2 DHCP Server</h3>

<p>
If you want to use OpenBSD as a DHCP server
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dhcpd&amp;sektion=8">dhcpd(8)</a>,
edit <tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt> so that it contains the line <tt>dhcpd_flags=""</tt>.
Put the interfaces that you want
dhcpd to <b>listen</b> on in <tt>/etc/dhcpd.interfaces</tt>.

<pre>
     # <b>echo xl1 xl2 xl3 &gt;/etc/dhcpd.interfaces</b>
</pre>

<p>
Then, edit <tt>/etc/dhcpd.conf</tt>.
The options are pretty self-explanatory.

<pre>
        option  domain-name "example.com";
        option  domain-name-servers 192.168.1.3, 192.168.1.5;

        subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
                option routers 192.168.1.1;

                range 192.168.1.32 192.168.1.127;
        }
</pre>

<p>
This will tell your DHCP clients that the domain to append to DNS
requests is example.com (so, if the user types in 'telnet joe' then it
will send them to joe.example.com).  It will point them to DNS servers
192.168.1.3 and 192.168.1.5.  For hosts that are on the same network as
an ethernet interface on the OpenBSD machine, which is in the
192.168.1.0/24 range, it will assign them an IP address between
192.168.1.32 and 192.168.1.127.  It will set their default gateway as
192.168.1.1.

<p>
If you want to start dhcpd(8) from the command line, after editing
<tt>/etc/dhcpd.conf</tt>, try:

<pre>
     # <b>touch /var/db/dhcpd.leases</b>
     # <b>dhcpd fxp0</b>
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>touch</tt> line is needed to create an empty
<tt>dhcpd.leases</tt> file before dhcpd(8) can start.
The OpenBSD <a href="faq10.html#rc">startup scripts</a> will create this
file if needed on boot, but if you are starting dhcpd(8) manually,
you must create it first.
<tt>fxp0</tt> is an interface that you want to start serving DHCP on.

<p>
If you are serving DHCP to a Windows box, you may want dhcpd(8) to give
the client a 'WINS' server address.  To make this happen, just add the
following line to your <tt>/etc/dhcpd.conf</tt>:

<pre>
     option    netbios-name-servers    192.168.92.55;
</pre>

<p>
(where <tt>192.168.92.55</tt> is the IP of your Windows or Samba
server.) See
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dhcp-options&amp;sektion=5">dhcp-options(5)</a>
for more options that your DHCP clients may want.


<p>
<a name="PPP"></a>
<h2>6.5 - PPP </h2>

<p>
The Point to Point Protocol (PPP) is generally what is used to create a
connection to your ISP via a dial-up modem. OpenBSD has 2 ways of doing this:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pppd&amp;sektion=8">pppd(8)</a>
 - the kernel PPP daemon
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ppp&amp;sektion=8">ppp(8)</a>
 - the userland PPP daemon 
</ul>

<p>
Both ppp and pppd perform similar functions, in different ways.
pppd works with the kernel
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ppp&amp;sektion=4">ppp(4)</a>
driver, whereas ppp works in userland with
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tun&amp;sektion=4">tun(4)</a>.
This document will cover only the userland PPP daemon, since it is
easier to debug and to interact with. To start
off you will need some simple information about your ISP. Here is a list
of helpful information that you will need.

<ul>
<li>Your ISP's dial-up number
<li>Your nameserver 
<li>Your username and password
<li>Your gateway
</ul>

<p>
Some of these you can do without, but would be helpful in setting up
ppp. The userland PPP daemon uses the file 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/etc/ppp/ppp.conf.sample">/etc/ppp/ppp.conf</a>
as its configuration file. There are many helpful files in
<i>/etc/ppp</i> that can have different setups for many different
situations. You should take a browse through that directory.

<p>
<h3>Initial Setup - for PPP(8)</h3>

<p>
Initial Setup for the userland PPP daemon consists of editing your
<i>/etc/ppp/ppp.conf</i> file. This file doesn't exist by default, but
there is a file <i>/etc/ppp/ppp.conf.sample</i> which you can simply
edit to create your own <i>ppp.conf</i> file. Here I will start with the
simplest and probably most used setup.  Here is a quick
<i>ppp.conf</i> file that simply sets some defaults:

<blockquote>
<pre>
default:
set log Phase Chat LCP IPCP CCP tun command     
set device /dev/cua01                           
set speed 115200     
set dial "ABORT BUSY ABORT NO\\sCARRIER TIMEOUT 5 \"\" AT OK-AT-OK ATE1Q0 OK \\dATDT\\T TIMEOUT 40 CONNECT"
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The section under the <tt>default:</tt> tag gets executed each time.
Here we set up all our critical information. With &quot;set
log&quot; we set our logging levels. This can be changed: refer to
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ppp&amp;sektion=8">ppp(8)</a>
for more info on setting up logging levels. Our device gets set with
&quot;set device&quot;. This is the device that the modem is on. In this
example the modem is on com port 2. Therefore com port 1 would be
<i>/dev/cua00</i>. With &quot;set speed&quot; we set the speed of our
dial-up connection and with &quot;set dial&quot; we set our dial-up
parameters. With this we can change our timeout time, etc. This line
should stay pretty much as it is though.

<p>
Now we can move on and set up information specific to our ISP. We do
this by adding another tag under our <tt>default:</tt> section. This tag
can be called anything you want - easiest to just use the name of your
ISP.  Here I will use <tt>myisp:</tt> as our tag referring to our ISP.
Here is a simple setup incorporating all we need to get ourselves
connected:

<blockquote>
<pre>
myisp:
set phone 1234567   
set login "ABORT NO\\sCARRIER TIMEOUT 5 ogin:--ogin: ppp word: ppp"
set timeout 120   
set ifaddr 10.0.0.1/0 10.0.0.2/0 255.255.255.0 0.0.0.0
add default HISADDR 
enable dns
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here we have set up essential info for that specific ISP. The first
option &quot;set phone&quot; sets your ISP's dial-up number. The
&quot;set login&quot; sets our login options. Here we have the timeout
set to 5; this means that we will abort our login attempt after 5
seconds if no carrier is found. Otherwise it will wait for &quot;login:&quot;
to be sent and send in your username and password.

<p>
In this example our
Username = ppp and Password = ppp. These values will need to be changed.
The line &quot;set timeout&quot; sets the idle timeout for the entire
connection duration to 120 seconds. The &quot;set ifaddr&quot; line is a
little tricky. Here is a more extensive explanation.

<blockquote><pre>
set ifaddr 10.0.0.1/0 10.0.0.2/0 255.255.255.0 0.0.0.0
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
In the above line, we have it set in the format of &quot;<b>set ifaddr
[myaddr[/nn] [hisaddr[/nn] [netmask [triggeraddr]]]]</b>&quot;. So the
first IP specified is what we want as our IP. If you have a static IP
address, you set it here. In our example we use /0 which says that no
bits of this IP address need to match and the whole thing can be
replaced. The second IP specified is what we expect as their IP. If you
know this you can specify it. Again in our line we don't know what will
be assigned, so we let them tell us. The third option is our netmask,
here set to 255.255.255.0.  If triggeraddr is specified, it is used in
place of myaddr in the initial IPCP negotiation.  However, only an
address in the myaddr range will be accepted.  This is useful when
negotiating with some PPP implementations that will not assign an IP
number unless their peer requests ``0.0.0.0''.

<p>
The next option used &quot;add default HISADDR&quot; sets our default
route to their IP. This is 'sticky', meaning that if their IP should
change, our route will automatically be updated. With &quot;enable
dns&quot; we are telling our ISP to authenticate our nameserver
addresses. Do NOT do this if you are running a local DNS, as ppp will
simply circumvent its use by entering some nameserver lines in
<i>/etc/resolv.conf</i>.

<p>
Instead of traditional login methods, many ISPs now use either CHAP or
PAP authentication. If this is the case, our configuration will look
slightly different:

<blockquote>
<pre>
myisp:
set phone 1234567   
set authname ppp
set authkey ppp
set login
set timeout 120   
set ifaddr 10.0.0.1/0 10.0.0.2/0 255.255.255.0 0.0.0.0
add default HISADDR 
enable dns
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the above example, we specify our username (ppp) and password (ppp)
using authname and authkey, respectively. There is no need to specify
whether CHAP or PAP authentication is used - it will be negotiated
automatically. "set login" merely specifies to attempt to log in, with
the username and password previously specified.

<p>
<h3>Using PPP(8)</h3>

<p>
Now that we have our <i>ppp.conf</i> file set up we can start trying to
make a connection to our ISP. I will detail some commonly used arguments
with ppp:

<ul>
<li><tt>ppp -auto myisp</tt> - This will run ppp, configure your
interfaces and connect to your ISP and then go into the background.
<li><tt>ppp -ddial myisp</tt> - This is similar to -auto, but if your
connection is dropped it will try and reconnect.
</ul>

<p>
If the above fails, try running <i>/usr/sbin/ppp</i> with no options - it
will run ppp in interactive mode. The options can be specified one by
one to check for error or other problems. Using the setup specified above,
ppp will log to /var/log/ppp.log. That log, as well as the man page,
all contain helpful information.

<p>
<h3>ppp(8) extras</h3>

<p>
In some situations you might want commands executed as your connection
is made or dropped. There are two files you can create for just these
situations: <i>/etc/ppp/ppp.linkup</i> and <i>/etc/ppp/ppp.linkdown</i>.
Sample configurations can be viewed here:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/etc/ppp/ppp.linkup.sample">ppp.linkup</a>
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/etc/ppp/ppp.linkdown.sample">ppp.linkdown</a>
</ul>

<p>
<h3>ppp(8) variations</h3>

<p>
Many ISPs now offer xDSL services, which are faster than traditional
dial-up methods. This includes variants such as ADSL and SDSL.
Although no physical dialling takes place, connection is still based on the
Point to Point Protocol. Examples include:

<ul>
<li>PPPoE
<li>PPPoA
<li>PPTP
</ul>

<p>
<h3>PPPoE/PPPoA</h3>

<p>
The Point to Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) is a method for sending
PPP packets in Ethernet frames.
The Point to Point Protocol over ATM (PPPoA) is typically run on ATM networks,
such as those found in the UK and Belgium.

<p>
Typically this means you can establish a connection with
your ISP using just a standard Ethernet card and Ethernet-based DSL modem
(as opposed to a USB-only modem).

<p>
If you have a modem which speaks PPPoE/PPPoA, it is possible to configure
the modem to do the connecting. Alternatively, if the modem has a `bridge'
mode, it is possible to enable this and have the modem "pass through" the
packets to a machine running PPPoE software (see below).

<p>
The main software interface to PPPoE/PPPoA on OpenBSD is
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pppoe&amp;sektion=8">pppoe(8)</a>,
which is a userland implementation (in much the same way that we described
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ppp&amp;sektion=8">ppp(8)</a>,
above).
A kernel PPPoE implementation,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pppoe&amp;sektion=4">pppoe(4)</a>,
has been incorporated into OpenBSD -current; however, this will not be
available to non-current users until OpenBSD 3.7.
<!-- XXXrelease -->

<p>
<h3>PPTP</h3>

<p>
The Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is a proprietary Microsoft
protocol.
A pptp client is available which interfaces with
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pppd&amp;sektion=8">pppd(8)</a>
and is capable of connecting to the PPTP-based Virtual Private Networks (VPN)
used by some cable and xDSL providers.
pptp itself must be installed from <a href="faq8.html#Ports">ports</a> or
<a href="faq8.html#Packages">packages</a>.
Further instructions on setting up and using pptp are available in the man page
which is installed with the pptp package.

<p>
<a name="Tuning"></a>
<h2>6.6 - Tuning networking parameters</h2>
<!-- XXXrelease -->

<p>
<h3>6.6.1 - How can I tweak the kernel so that there are a higher number
of retries and longer timeouts for TCP sessions?</h3>

<p>
You would normally use this to allow for routing or connection problems.
Of course, for it to be most effective, both sides of the connection
need to use similar values.

<p>
To tweak this, use <tt>sysctl</tt> and increase the values of:

<pre>
net.inet.tcp.keepinittime
net.inet.tcp.keepidle
net.inet.tcp.keepintvl
</pre>

<p>
Using sysctl -a, you can see the current values of these (and many
other) parameters.  To change one, do something like
<tt>sysctl net.inet.tcp.keepidle=28800</tt>.

<p>
<h3>6.6.2 - How can I turn on directed broadcasts?</h3>

<p>
Normally, you don't want to do this.  This allows someone to send
traffic to the broadcast address(es) of your connected network(s) if you
are using your OpenBSD box as a router.

<p>
There are some instances, in closed networks, where this may be useful,
particularly when using older implementations of the NetBIOS protocol.
This is another sysctl.
<tt>sysctl net.inet.ip.directed-broadcast=1</tt> turns this on.  Read
about <a href="http://www.netscan.org">smurf attacks</a> if you want to
know why it is off by default.

<p>
<h3>6.6.3 - I don't want the kernel to dynamically allocate a certain
port</h3>

<p>
There is a sysctl for this also.  From
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sysctl&amp;sektion=8">sysctl(8)</a>:

<pre>
Set the list of reserved TCP ports that should not be allocated by the
kernel dynamically.  This can be used to keep daemons from stealing a
specific port that another program needs to function.  List elements may
be separated by commas and/or whitespace.

 #  <strong>sysctl net.inet.tcp.baddynamic=749,750,751,760,761,871</strong>

It is also possible to add or remove ports from the current list.

 #  <strong>sysctl net.inet.tcp.baddynamic=+748</strong>
 #  <strong>sysctl net.inet.tcp.baddynamic=-871</strong>
</pre>


<p>
<a name="NFS"></a>
<h2>6.7 - Simple NFS usage</h2>

<p>
NFS, or Network File System, is used to share a filesystem over the
network. A few choice man pages to read before trying to setup a NFS
server are:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=nfsd&amp;sektion=8">nfsd(8)</a>
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mountd&amp;sektion=8">mountd(8)</a>
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=exports&amp;sektion=5">exports(5)</a>
</ul>

<p>
This section will go through the steps for a simple setup of NFS. This
example details a server on a LAN, with clients accessing NFS on the
LAN. It does not talk about securing NFS. We presume you have already
setup packet filtering or other firewalling protection, to prevent
outside access.  If you are allowing outside access to your NFS server,
and you have any kind of sensitive data stored on it, we strongly
recommend that you employ IPsec.  Otherwise, people can potentially see
your NFS traffic.  Someone could also pretend to be the IP address which
you are allowing into your NFS server.  There are several attacks that
can result.  When properly configured, IPsec protects against these
types of attacks.

<p>
Another important security note.  Don't just add a filesystem to
<i>/etc/exports</i> without some kind of list of allowed host(s).
Without a list of hosts which can mount a particular directory, anyone
on who can reach your host will be able to mount your NFS exports.

<p>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=portmap&amp;sektion=8">portmap(8)</a>
must be running for NFS to operate.  Portmap(8) is off by
default on OpenBSD 3.2 and later, so you must add the line

<blockquote><pre>
portmap=YES
</pre></blockquote>

to
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rc.conf.local&amp;sektion=8">rc.conf.local(8)</a>
and reboot. 

<p>
The setup consists of a server with the ip <b>10.0.0.1</b>. This server
will be serving NFS only to clients within that network. The first step
to setting up NFS is to setup your <i>/etc/exports</i> file. This file
lists which filesystems you wish to have accessible via NFS and defines
who is able to access them. There are many options that you can use in
your <i>/etc/exports</i> file, and it is best that you read the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=exports&amp;sektion=5">exports(5)</a>
man page. For this example we have an <i>/etc/exports</i> that looks
like this:

<blockquote><pre>
#
# NFS exports Database
# See exports(5) for more information.  Be very careful, misconfiguration
# of this file can result in your filesystems being readable by the world.
/work -alldirs -ro -network 10.0.0 -mask 255.255.255.0
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This means that the local filesystem <tt>/work</tt> will be made
available via NFS. <tt>-alldirs</tt> specifies that clients will be able
to mount at any point under the <tt>/work</tt> mount point. <tt>-ro</tt>
specifies that it will only be allowed to be mounted read-only. The last
two arguments specify that only clients within the 10.0.0.0 network
using a netmask of 255.255.255.0 will be authorized to mount this
filesystem. This is important for some servers that are accessible by
different networks.

<p>
Once your <i>/etc/exports</i> file is setup, you can go ahead and setup
your NFS server. You should first make sure that options NFSSERVER &amp;
NFSCLIENT are in your kernel configuration. (GENERIC kernel has these
options included.) Next, you should add the line <tt>nfs_server=YES</tt> to
<i>/etc/rc.conf.local</i>. This will bring up both nfsd(8) and mountd(8) when
you reboot. Now, you can go ahead and start the daemons yourself. These
daemons need to be started as root, and you need to make sure that
portmap(8) is running on your system. Here is an example of starting
nfsd(8) which serves on both TCP and UDP using 4 daemons.  You should
set an appropriate number of NFS server daemons to handle the maximum
number of concurrent client requests that you want to service.

<blockquote><pre>
# <strong>/sbin/nfsd -tun 4</strong>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Not only do you have to start the nfsd(8) server, but you need to start
mountd(8). This is the daemon that actually services the mount requests
on NFS. To start mountd(8), make sure an empty mountdtab file exists,
and run the daemon:

<blockquote><pre>
# <strong>echo -n &gt;/var/db/mountdtab</strong>
# <strong>/sbin/mountd</strong>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you make changes to /etc/exports while NFS is already running, you
need to make mountd aware of this!  Just HUP it:

<blockquote><pre>
# <strong>kill -HUP `cat /var/run/mountd.pid`</strong>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<h3>Checking Stats on NFS</h3>

<p>
From here, you can check to make sure that all these daemons are up and
registered with RPC. To do this, use rpcinfo(8).

<blockquote><pre>
$ <strong>rpcinfo -p 10.0.0.1</strong>
   program vers proto   port
    100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
    100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
    100005    1   udp    633  mountd
    100005    3   udp    633  mountd
    100005    1   tcp    916  mountd
    100005    3   tcp    916  mountd
    100003    2   udp   2049  nfs
    100003    3   udp   2049  nfs
    100003    2   tcp   2049  nfs
    100003    3   tcp   2049  nfs
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
During normal usage, there are a few other utilities that allow you to
see what is happening with NFS. One is
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=showmount&amp;sektion=8">showmount(8)</a>, 
which allows you to view what is currently mounted and who is mounting
it. There is also nfsstat(8) which shows much more verbose statistics.
To use showmount(8), try <tt>/usr/bin/showmount -a host</tt>. For
example:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <strong>/usr/bin/showmount -a 10.0.0.1</strong>
All mount points on 10.0.0.1:
10.0.0.37:/work
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<h3>Mounting NFS Filesystems</h3>

<p>
NFS filesystems should be mounted via mount(8), or more specifically,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mount_nfs&amp;sektion=8">mount_nfs(8)</a>.
To mount a filesystem <i>/work</i> on host 10.0.0.1 to local filesystem
<i>/mnt</i>, do this (note that you don't need to use an IP address;
mount will resolve host names):

<blockquote><pre>
# <strong>mount -t nfs 10.0.0.1:/work /mnt</strong>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
To have your system mount upon boot,
add something like this to your <i>/etc/fstab</i>:

<blockquote><pre>
10.0.0.1:/work /mnt nfs rw 0 0
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
It is important that you use <tt>0 0</tt> at the end of this line so
that your computer does not try to fsck the NFS filesystem on boot!!!!
The other standard security options, such as noexec, nodev, and nosuid,
should also be used where applicable.  Such as:

<blockquote><pre>
10.0.0.1:/work /mnt nfs rw,nodev,nosuid 0 0
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This way, no devices or setuid programs on the NFS server can subvert
security measures on the NFS client.  If you are not mounting programs
which you expect to run on the NFS client, add noexec to this list.


<a name="Bridge"></a>
<h2>6.9 - Setting up a network bridge in OpenBSD</h2>

<p>
A <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=bridge&amp;sektion=4">bridge</a>
is a link between two or more separate networks.  Unlike a router, 
packets transfer through the bridge "invisibly" -- logically, the two
network segments appear to be one segment to nodes on either side of the
bridge.  The bridge will only forward packets that have to pass from one
segment to the other, so among other things, they provide an easy way to
reduce traffic in a complex network and yet allow any node to access any
other node when needed.

<p>
Note that because of this "invisible" nature, an interface in a  bridge
may or may not have an IP address of its own.  If it does, the interface
has effectively two modes of operation, one as part of a bridge, the
other as a normal, stand-alone NIC.  If neither interface has an IP
address, the bridge will pass network data, but will not be externally
maintainable (which can be a feature).

<p>
<h3>An example of a bridge application</h3>

<p>
One of my computer racks has a number of older systems, none of which
have a built-in 10BASE-TX NIC.  While they all have an AUI or AAUI
connector, my supply of transceivers is limited to coax.  One of the
machines on this rack is an OpenBSD-based terminal server which is always
on and connected to the high-speed network.  Adding a second NIC with a
coax port will allow me to use this machine as a bridge to the coax
network.

<p>
This system has two NICs in it now, an Intel EtherExpress/100
(<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fxp&amp;sektion=4"><tt>fxp0</tt></a>)
and a 3c590-Combo card 
(<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ep&amp;sektion=4"><tt>ep0</tt></a>)
for the coax port.  <tt>fxp0</tt> is the link to the
rest of my network and will thus have an IP address, <tt>ep0</tt> is
going to be for bridging only and will have no IP address.
Machines attached to the coax segment will communicate as if they
were on the rest of my network.  So, how do we make this happen?

<p>
The file <tt>hostname.fxp0</tt> contains the configuration info for
the <tt>fxp0</tt> card.  This machine is set up using DHCP, so its file
looks like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ <b>cat /etc/hostname.fxp0</b>
dhcp NONE NONE NONE NONE
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
No surprises here.

<p>
The <tt>ep0</tt> card is a bit different, as you might guess:

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ <b>cat /etc/hostname.ep0</b>
up media 10base2
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, we are instructing the system to activate this interface using 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ifconfig&amp;sektion=8">ifconfig(8)</a>
and set it to 10BASE-2 (coax).  No IP address or similar information
needs to be specified for this interface.  The options the <tt>ep</tt>
card accepts are detailed in its
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ep&amp;sektion=4">man page</a>.

<p>
Now, we need to set up the bridge.  Bridges are initialized by the
existence of a file named something like 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=bridgename.if&amp;sektion=5"><tt>bridgename.bridge0</tt></a>. 
Here is an example for my situation here:

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ <b>cat /etc/bridgename.bridge0</b>
add fxp0
add ep0
up
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is saying set up a bridge consisting of the two NICs, fxp0 and ep0,
and activate it.  Does it matter which order the cards are listed?  No,
remember a bridge is very symmetrical -- packets flow in and out in both
directions.

<p>
That's it!  Reboot, and you now have a functioning bridge.

<p>
<h3>Filtering on a bridge</h3>

While there are certainly uses for a simple bridge like this, it is
likely you might want to DO something with the packets as they go
through your bridge.  As you might expect, <a href="#PF">Packet
Filter</a> can be used to restrict what traffic goes through your
bridge.

<p>
Keep in mind, by the nature of a bridge, the same data flows through
both interfaces, so you only need to filter on one interface.  Your
default "Pass all" statements would look something like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
pass in  on ep0  all
pass out on ep0  all
pass in  on fxp0 all
pass out on fxp0 all
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Now, let's say I wish to filter traffic hitting these old machines, I
want only Web and SSH traffic to reach them.  In this case, we are going
to let all traffic in and out of the <tt>ep0</tt> interface, but filter on the
<tt>fxp0</tt> interface, using <tt>keep state</tt> to handle the reply data:

<blockquote>
<pre>
# Pass all traffic through ep0
pass in quick on ep0 all
pass out quick on ep0 all

# Block fxp0 traffic
block in  on fxp0 all
block out on fxp0 all

pass in quick on fxp0 proto tcp from any to any port {22, 80} \
     flags S/SA keep state
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that this rule set will prevent anything but incoming HTTP and SSH
traffic  from reaching either the bridge machine or any of the other
nodes "behind" it.  Other results could be had by filtering the other
interface.

<p>
To monitor and control the bridge you have created, use the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=brconfig&amp;sektion=8">brconfig(8)</a>
command, which can also be used to create a bridge after boot.

<p>
<h3>Tips on bridging</h3>

<ul>
<li>It is HIGHLY recommended that you filter on only one interface.
While it is possible to filter on both, you really need to understand
this very well to do it right.

<li>By using the <i>blocknonip</i> option of 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=brconfig&amp;sektion=8">brconfig(8)</a>
or in 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=bridgename.if&amp;sektion=5">bridgename.bridge0</a>,
you can prevent non-IP traffic (such as IPX or NETBEUI) from slipping
around your filters.  This may be important in some situations, but you
should be aware that bridges work for all kinds of traffic, not just IP.

<li>Bridging requires that the NICs be in a "Promiscuous mode" -- they
listen to ALL network traffic, not just that directed at the interface.
This will put a higher load on the processor and bus than one might
expect.  Some NICs don't work properly in this mode, the TI ThunderLAN
chip
(<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tl&amp;sektion=4">tl(4)</a>)
is an example of a chip that won't work as part of a bridge. 
</ul>

<a name="PXE"></a>
<h2>6.10 - How do I boot using PXE? (i386, amd64)</h2>
The Preboot Execution Environment, or PXE, is a way to boot a computer
from the network, rather than from a hard disk, a floppy or a CD-ROM.
The technology was originally developed by Intel, but is supported
by most major network card and computer manufacturers now.
Note that there are several different network boot protocols, PXE is
relatively recent.
Traditionally, PXE booting is done using ROMs on the NIC or mainboard
of the system, but boot floppies are available from various sources
that will permit PXE booting, as well.
Many ROMs on older NICs support network booting but do NOT support PXE;
OpenBSD/i386 or amd64 cannot currently be booted across the network by these.



<p>
<h3>How does PXE booting work?</h3>
First, it is wise to understand how <a href="faq14.html#Boot386">OpenBSD
boots</a> on i386 and amd64 platforms.
Upon starting the boot process, the PXE-capable NIC broadcasts a DHCP
request over the network.
The DHCP server will assign the adapter an IP address, and gives it
the name of a file to be retrieved from a 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tftp&amp;sektion=1"
>tftp(1)</a> server and executed.
This file then conducts the rest of the boot process.
For OpenBSD, the file is
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pxeboot&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386"
>pxeboot</a>, which takes the place of the standard
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=boot&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">
boot(8)</a> file.
pxeboot(8) is then able to load and execute a kernel (such as
<tt>bsd</tt> or <a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd"><tt>bsd.rd</tt></a>) from the
same tftp(1) server.

<h3>How do I do it?</h3>
The first and obvious step is you must have a PXE-boot capable computer
or network adapter.
Some documentation will indicate all modern NICs and computers are PXE
capable, but this is clearly not true -- many low cost systems do not
include PXE ROMs or use an older network boot protocol.
You also need a properly configured <a href="#DHCP">DHCP</a> and TFTP server.

<p>
Assuming an OpenBSD machine is the source of the boot files (this is
NOT required), your DHCP server
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dhcpd.conf&amp;sektion=5">dhcpd.conf</a>
file will need to have the following line:
<pre>
    filename "pxeboot";
</pre>
to have the DHCP server offer that file to the booting workstation.
For example:

<pre>
    shared-network LOCAL-NET {
            option  domain-name "example.com";
            option  domain-name-servers 192.168.1.3, 192.168.1.5;

            subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
                    option routers 192.168.1.1;
                    <b>filename "pxeboot";</b>
                    range 192.168.1.32 192.168.1.127;
                    default-lease-time 86400;
                    max-lease-time 90000;
            }
    }
</pre>

<p>
You will also have to activate the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tftpd&amp;sektion=8">tftpd(8)</a>
daemon.  This is typically done through 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;sektion=8"
>inetd(8)</a>.
The standard OpenBSD install has a sample line in <tt>inetd.conf</tt>
which will do nicely for you:
<pre>
    #tftp  dgram   udp  wait  root  /usr/libexec/tftpd   tftpd -s /tftpboot
</pre>

which simply needs to have the '#' character removed and send inetd(8) a 
-HUP signal to get it to reload <tt>/etc/inetd.conf</tt>.
tftpd(8) serves files from a particular directory, in the case of this
line, that directory is <tt>/tftpboot</tt>, which we will use for this
example. 
Obviously, this directory needs to be created and populated.
Typically, you will have only a few files here for PXE booting:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pxeboot&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386"
>pxeboot</a>, the PXE boot loader (serving the same function as
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=boot&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386"
>boot</a> on a disk-based system).
<li><a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a>, the install kernel or <tt>bsd</tt>,
a customized kernel.
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=boot.conf&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386"
>/etc/boot.conf</a>, a boot configuration file.
</ul>

Note that <tt>/etc/boot.conf</tt> is only needed if the kernel you wish to
boot from is not named <tt>bsd</tt>, or other pxeboot defaults are not 
as you need them (for example, you wish to use a serial console).
You can test your tftpd(8) server using a 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tftp&amp;sektion=1"
>tftp(1)</a> client, making sure you can fetch the needed files.

<p>
When your DHCP and TFTP servers are running, you are ready to try it.
You will have to activate the PXE boot on your system or network card;
consult your system documentation.
Once you have it set, you should see something similar to the following:

<pre>

<a name="CARP"></a>
<h2>6.11 - The Common Address Redundancy Protocol (CARP)</h2>
<h3>6.11.1 - What is CARP and how does it work?</h3>
<!-- This article written by Sunny Raspet, slr@mordac.info, and
released under the BSD license -->

<p>
CARP is a tool to help achieve system redundancy, by having multiple
computers creating a single, virtual network interface between them,
so that if any machine fails, another can respond instead, and/or
allowing a degree of load sharing between systems.
CARP is an improvement over the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol
(VRRP) standard.
It was developed after VRRP was deemed to be not free enough because of
a possibly-overlapping Cisco patent.
For more information on CARP's origins and the legal issues surrounding
VRRP, please visit <a href="../lyrics.html#35">this page</a>.

<p>
To avoid legal conflicts, Ryan McBride (with help from Michael
Shalayeff, Marco Pfatschbacher and Markus Friedl) designed CARP to be
fundamentally different.
The inclusion of cryptography is the most prominent change, but still
only one of many.

<p>
How it works: CARP is a multicast protocol.
It groups several physical computers together under one or more virtual
addresses.
Of these, one system is the master and responds to all packets destined
for the group, the other systems act as hot spares.
No matter what the IP and MAC address of the local physical interface,
packets sent to the CARP address are returned with the CARP information.

<p>
At configurable intervals, the master advertises its operation on IP
protocol number 112.
If the master goes offline, the other systems in the CARP group begin to
advertise.
The host that's able to advertise most frequently becomes the new
master.
When the main system comes back up, it becomes a back up host by
default, although if it's more desirable for one host to be master
whenever possible (e.g. one host is a fast Sun Fire V120 and the
others are comparatively slow SPARCstation IPCs), you can so configure
them.

<p>
While highly redundant and fault-tolerant hardware minimizes the need
for CARP, it doesn't erase it.
There's no hardware fault tolerance that's capable of helping if someone
knocks out a power cord, or if your system administrator types
<tt>reboot</tt> in the wrong window.
CARP also makes it easier to make the patch and reboot cycle transparent
to users, and easier to test a software or hardware upgrade--if it
doesn't work, you can fall back to your spare until fixed.

<p>There are, however, situations in which CARP won't help.
CARP's design does require that the members of a group be on the same
physical subnet, and each interface requires a real, static IP address,
in addition to a static CARP IP address.
Similarly, services that require a constant connection to the server
(such as SSH or IRC) will not be transparently transferred to the other
system--though in this case, CARP can help with minimizing downtime.
CARP by itself does not synchronize data between applications, this has
to be done through "alternative channels" such as 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pfsync&amp;sektion=4">pfsync(4)</a>
(for redundant filtering), manually duplicating data between boxes with
<a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a>, or whatever is appropriate
for your application.

 

<h3>6.11.2 - Configuration</h3>

<p>
CARP's controls are located in two places:
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sysctl&amp;sektion=8">sysctl(8)</a>
and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ifconfig&amp;sektion=8">ifconfig(8)</a>.
Let's look at the sysctls first.

<p>The first sysctl, <tt>net.inet.carp.allow</tt>, defines whether the
host handles CARP packets at all.
Clearly, this is necessary to use CARP.
This sysctl is enabled by default.

<p>
The second, <tt>net.inet.carp.arpbalance</tt>, is used for load
balancing.
If this feature is enabled, CARP source-hashes the originating IP of a
request.
The hash is then used to select a virtual host from the available pool
to handle the request.
This is disabled by default.

<p>The third, <tt>net.inet.carp.log</tt>, logs CARP errors.
Disabled by default.

<p>Fourth, <tt>net.inet.carp.preempt</tt> enables natural selection
among CARP hosts.
The most fit for the job (that is to say, able to advertise most
frequently) will become master.
Disabled by default, meaning a system that is not a master will
not attempt to (re)gain master status.

<p>
All these sysctl variables are documented in
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sysctl&amp;sektion=3">sysctl(3)</a>.

<p>For the remainder of CARP's configuration, we rely on
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ifconfig&amp;sektion=8">ifconfig(8)</a>.
Two of the four CARP-specific commands, <tt>advbase</tt> and
<tt>advskew</tt>, deal with the interval between CARP advertisements.
The formula (in seconds) is <tt>advskew</tt> divided by 255, then added
to <tt>advbase</tt>.
<tt>advbase</tt> can be used to decrease network
traffic or allow longer latency before a backup host takes over;
<tt>advskew</tt> lets you control which host will be master without much
delaying failover (should that be required).

<p>Next, <tt>pass</tt> sets a password, and <tt>vhid</tt> sets the
virtual host identifier number of the CARP group.
You need to assign a unique number for each CARP group, even if (for
load balancing purposes) they share the same IP address.
CARP is limited to 255 groups.

<p>Let's put all these settings together in a basic configuration.
Let's say you're deploying two identically configured Web servers,
<i>rachael</i> (192.168.0.5) and <i>pris</i> (192.168.0.6), to replace
an older system that was at 192.168.0.7.  The commands:

<blockquote><pre>
rachael# <b>ifconfig carp0 create</b>
rachael# <b>ifconfig carp0 vhid 1 pass tyrell 192.168.0.7</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>create the carp0 interface and give it a vhid of 1, a password of
<i>tyrell</i>, and the IP address 192.168.0.7.
To make it permanent across reboots, you can create an
<tt>/etc/hostname.carp0</tt> file that looks like this:

<blockquote><pre>
inet 192.168.0.7 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.255 vhid 1 pass tyrell 
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Do the same on <i>pris</i>. Whichever system brings the CARP interface
up first will be master.

<p>
Note that in a machine with multiple interfaces, the CARP interface is 
on the same subnet as the physical interface.  

<p>

But let's say you're not deploying from scratch.
<i>Rachael</i> was already in place at the address 192.168.0.7.
How do you work around that?
Fortunately, CARP has no problem with one system having an IP both as
its physical interface address and in a CARP group, so there's no need
to change the commands above.
However, it tends to be cleaner to have an IP for each system--it makes
individual monitoring and access much simpler.

<p>Let's add another layer of complexity; we want <i>rachael</i> to stay
master when possible.
There are several reasons we might want this: hardware differences,
simple prejudice, "if this system isn't master, there's a problem," or
knowing the default master without doing scripting to parse and email
the output of ifconfig.

<p>On <i>rachael</i>, we'll use the sysctl we created above, then edit
<tt>/etc/sysctl.conf</tt> to make it permanent.

<blockquote><pre>
rachael# <b>sysctl net.inet.carp.preempt=1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>We'll do configuration on <i>pris</i>, too:

<blockquote><pre>
pris# <b>ifconfig carp0 advskew 100</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This slightly delays <i>pris</i>'s advertisements, meaning
<i>rachael</i> will be master when alive.

<p>
Note that if you are using PF on a CARP'd computer, you must pass 
"proto carp" on all involved interfaces, with a line similar to:
<blockquote><pre>
pass on fxp0 proto carp keep state
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>6.11.3 - Load balancing</h3>

<p>Flash forward a few months. Our company of the previous example has
grown to the point where a single internal Web server is just barely
managing the load. What to do?  CARP to the rescue.  It's time to try
load balancing. Create a new CARP interface and group on <i>rachael</i>:

<blockquote><pre>
rachael# <b>ifconfig carp1 create</b>
rachael# <b>ifconfig carp1 vhid 2 advskew 100 pass bryant 192.168.0.7</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>On <i>pris</i>, we'll create the new group and interface as well, then set
the "preempt" sysctl:

<blockquote><pre>
pris# <b>ifconfig create carp1</b>
pris# <b>ifconfig carp1 vhid 2 pass bryant 192.168.0.7</b>
pris# <b>sysctl net.inet.carp.preempt=1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Now we have two CARP groups with the same IP address.
Each group is skewed toward a different host, which means <i>rachael</i>
will stay master of the original group, but <i>pris</i> will take over
the new one.

<p>All we have to do now is enable the load balancing sysctl we
discussed previously on both machines:

<blockquote><pre>
# <strong>sysctl net.inet.carp.arpbalance=1</strong>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>While these examples are for a two-machine cluster, the same
principles apply to more systems.
Please note, however, that it's not expected that you will achieve
perfect 50/50 distribution between the two machines--CARP uses a hash of
the originating IP address to determine which system handles the
request, rather than by load.

<h2>6.12 - Using OpenNTPD</h2>
Accurate time is important for many computer applications.
However, many people have noticed that their $5 watch can keep better
time than their $2000 computer.
In addition to knowing what time it is, it is also often important to 
synchronize computers so that they all agree on what time it is.
For some time, <a href="http://www.ntp.org">ntp.org</a> has 
produced a Network Time Protocol
(<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1305.txt">RFC1305</a>,
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2030.txt">RFC2030</a>)
application, available through <a href="faq8.html#Ports">ports</a>,
which can be used to synchronize clocks on computers over the Internet.
However, it is a nontrivial program to set up, difficult code to audit,
and has a large memory requirement.
In short, it fills an important role for some people, but it is far
from a solution for all.

<p>
<a href="http://www.openntpd.org">OpenNTPD</a> is an attempt to resolve
some of these problems, making a trivial-to-administer, safe and simple
NTP compatible way to have accurate time on your computer.
OpenBSD's 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ntpd&amp;sektion=8">ntpd(8)</a>
is controlled with an easy to understand configuration file,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ntpd.conf&amp;sektion=5"><tt>/etc/ntpd.conf</tt></a>.

<p>
Simply activating ntpd(8) through <a href="faq10.html#rc">rc.conf.local</a>
will result in your computer synchronizing itself to the 
<a href="http://www.pool.ntp.org/">pool.ntp.org</a> servers,
a collection of publicly available time servers.
<!-- XXXversion 3.6 only -->
If the clock on your computer is very far off, you should first
set it as closely as possible, possibly using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rdate&amp;sektion=8">rdate(8)</a>,
as ntpd(8) adjusts your clock VERY slowly using 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=adjtime&amp;sektion=2">adjtime(2)</a>
-- it may take <i>many hours</i> (or days or even longer) to synchronize
a clock that is only a couple minutes off (<i>-current</i> will
immediately set the clock on boot).

Once your clock is accurately set, ntpd will hold it at a high 
degree of accuracy.

<a name="OpenNTPDaccurate"></a>
<h3>6.12.1 - "But OpenNTPD isn't as accurate as the ntp.org daemon!"</h3>
That may be true.
That wasn't OpenNTPD's 
<a href="http://www.openntpd.org/goals.html">design goal</a>, it was
intended to be free, simple, reliable and secure.
If you really need microsecond precision more than the benefits of
OpenNTPD, feel free to use ntp.org's ntpd, as it will remain available
through ports and packages.
There is no plan or desire to have OpenNTPD bloated with every
imaginable feature.

<a name="OpenNTPDharmful"></a>
<h3>6.12.2 - "Someone has claimed that OpenNTPD is 'harmful'!"</h3>
That would probably be 
<a href="http://bradknowles.typepad.com/considered_harmful/2004/09/openntpd.html">Brad
Knowles</a>.
If accurate time keeping is important, a number of users have reported
better results from OpenNTPD than from ntp.org's ntpd.
If security is important, OpenNTPD's code is much more readable (and
thus, auditable) and was written using native OpenBSD function calls
like
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=strlcpy&amp;sektion=3">strlcpy</a>,
rather than more portable functions like 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=strcpy&amp;sektion=3">strcpy</a>,
and written to be secure from the beginning, not "made secure later".
If having more people using time synchronization is valuable, OpenNTPD 
makes it much easier for larger numbers of people to use it.
If this is "harmful", we are all for it.

<p>
There are applications where the ntp.org ntpd is 
more appropriate; however it is felt that for the other 95% of the 
users, OpenNTPD is more than sufficient.

<a name="Wireless"></a>
<h2>6.13 - What are my wireless networking options?</h2>
OpenBSD has support for a few wireless chipsets:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=awi&amp;sektion=4">awi(4)</a>
AMD 802.11 PCnet Mobile
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=an&amp;sektion=4">an(4)</a>
Aironet Communications 4500/4800
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=wi&amp;sektion=4">wi(4)</a>
Prism2/2.5/3
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=atw&amp;sektion=4">atw(4)</a>
ADMtek ADM8211
</ul>
  
Adapters based on these chips can be used much like any other network
adapter to connect an OpenBSD system to an existing wireless network
(please see the manual pages for precise details).
The Prism2 and Prism3-based cards, however, can also be used in the
"Host-Based Access Point" mode, permitting them to be made into the
wireless access point for your network as part of your firewall.
Unfortunately, Prism2/3-based network adapters are no longer being
produced by most of the "mass market" manufacturers, as they have
switched to lower cost and newer chips, often
<a href="#GenSupport">without changing model number</a>.
Most of the manufacturers of newer chips have chosen to not release
documentation needed to produce free and open drivers for these
devices (feel free to contact the manufacturers and ask them to
change their policies).

<p>
Fortunately, Prism2/3-based adapters are still available through the
surplus and used market, and a few manufacturers understand the value
of a properly documented, open-source friendly chipset, and continue to
produce professional-grade Prism-based adapters.
One reseller of these cards is
<a href="http://www.netgate.com">Netgate.com</a>.
In general, if a manufacturer does not explicitly identify a current
product as being Prism-based, you can safely assume it is not compatible
with the wi(4) driver.
Note that the newest Prism-series chips (such as the Prism-GT) are not
supported.

<p>
Another option to consider for using your OpenBSD-based firewall to
provide wireless access is to use a conventional NIC and an external
bridging Access Point.
This has the added advantage of letting you easily position the antenna
where it is most effective, which is often not directly on the back of
your firewall.
