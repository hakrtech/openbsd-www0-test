</p>

<p>
<h3>Interfaces</h3>
</p>

<p>
Here we assume you have all your network interfaces working, and a basic
TCP/IP knowledge. If not, go to the <a href= "./faq5.html">Kernel Configuration
and Setup</a> section, and/or read a nice intro to TCP/IP. Other recommended
reading are the 
<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ifconfig&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">
ifconfig(8)</a> and 
<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=netstat&apropos=0&sektion=1&format=html">
netstat(1)</a> man pages.
</p>

<p>
All your interfaces should be listed with:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
# ifconfig -a

lo0: flags=8009&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,MULTICAST&gt;
        inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000
lo1: flags=8008&lt;LOOPBACK,MULTICAST&gt;
xl0: flags=8843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt;
        media: Ethernet 100baseTX half-duplex
        inet 10.1.1.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.1.1.255
sl0: flags=c010&ltPOINTOPOINT,LINK2,MULTICAST&gt;
        inet 10.1.1.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.1.1.255
sl0: flags=c010&lt;POINTOPOINT,LINK2,MULTICAST&gt;
sl1: flags=c010&lt;POINTOPOINT,LINK2,MULTICAST&gt;
ppp0: flags=8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt;
ppp1: flags=8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt;
tun0: flags=10&lt;POINTOPOINT&gt;
tun1: flags=10&lt;POINTOPOINT&gt;
enc0: flags=8&lt;LOOPBACK&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<p>
First there is lo0 the loopback interface. It MUST have the assigned address
of 127.0.0.1 no matter what network setup you use. The next important one is
xl0 in this example (could be neX or epX depending on the brand), which is
a board itself. Look it has UP and RUNNING flags on, as lo0 but no other
interface have them. That means oviously they are working. Your interface
could be down if you never configured it, and look like the other interfaces.
The others are not part of this section, as sl and ppp are for serial line
comunication, tun is a pseudo-device for tunneling and enc a pseudo-device for
encryption. 
</p>

<p>
If xl0 was uninitialized, you can assign it an address creating a ascii
file /etc/hostname.xl0 having a string like this:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
inet mona 255.255.255.0 NONE
</pre>
</p>

<p>        
Here "mona" is a name that exists as a record in /etc/hosts:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
10.1.1.1        mona    mona.openbsd.org.ar
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Now check that you have a file /etc/myname and a file /etc/mygate. If you
don't have them, you need to create them. If your gateway is a machine
named "wintermute" wich is also in the /etc/hosts, use this commands:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
# echo "mona" >> /etc/myname; echo "wintermute" >> /etc/mygate
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Ok, you are done for a standalone system, but to activate your
configuration now (without rebooting) do:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
# sh /etc/netstart
</pre>
</p>

<p>
This will give you a few errors, but don't worry as all them are
concerning 127.0.0.x (loopback)
</p>

<p>
Note: if you want to use the system as a gateway, later there's a
"Firewall Setup" section, but you need to read all this first.
</p>

<p>
Now check your routes are ok (here we use -n aso to make it simpler to
look at):
</p>

<p>
<pre>
# netstat -rn
Routing tables

</pre>
</p>

<p>
(The gateway here is shown as 10.1.1.254)
</p>

<p>
<h3>IP Aliasing</h3>
</p>

<p>
If you want to map more than one IP address on a single network interface,
you need to assign an "alias" to it. The way to do it on OpenBSD is
simply assigning the interface another IP with the "alias" option like
this:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
# ifconfig xl0 alias 10.1.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.255
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Here ne2 is assigned another IP number (remember it already has 10.1.1.1).
Note the netmask used! Don't use 255.255.255.0 in this kind of cases (both
numbers are on the same subnet), only ONE address shoud handle the subnet.
If you do such kind of misconfiguration the following error appears:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
ifconfig:SIOCAIFADDR: File exists
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Now let's change the configuration file for this, /etc/ifaliases. Add to
it this line:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
xl0   10.1.1.2 255.255.255.255
</pre>
</p>


<p>
<h3>DNS Client Setup</h3>
</p>

<p>
Let's assume your DNS servers are 125.2.3.4 and 125.2.3.5, and your
machine name belongs to the domain yourdomain.com. Add the following
lines to your /etc/resolv.conf file:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
domain yourdomain.com
nameserver 125.2.3.4
nameserver 125.2.3.5
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Gateway Setup</h3>
</p>

<p>
This is a minimal explanation, only for internal/secure networks! Read
Firewall Setup if you plan to put a gateway to internet.  
</p>

<p>
If you want to put a host that connects two subnets, and you want it to
"forward" any packet from them modify /etc/sysctl.conf line that toggles
the forwarding variable on bootup:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
net.inet.forwarding=1
</pre>
</p>

<p>
To make the changes without booting:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
# sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
net.inet.ip.forwarding: 0 -> 1
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Now modify the routes on the other hosts on both sides.
</p>

<p>
<a name= "6.2"></a>
<h2>6.2 - IPF/NAT Setup</h2>
</p>

<p>
<h3>IPF and IPNAT Setup</h3>
</p>

<p>
The IPFilter package was created to handle with two tasks, dealing with
packet level forwarding permissions and mapping hosts/subnets to a range of
external addresses. The configuration files are /etc/ipf.rules and
/etc/ipnat.rules, and also part of /etc/
</p>

<p>
rc.conf to activate them at boot time. You also need to have 
net.inet.ip.forwarding=1! You also need a kernel compiled with option
IPFILTER and IPFILTER_LOG (the GENERIC one present in the installation have
them).
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of nice examples on /usr/share/ipf/ for both. We recommend
you to choose the one closer to what you want, and modify it to fit your needs.
</p>

<p>
<h3>IPF</h3>
</p>

<p>
Modify rc.conf so it has IPFILTER=YES. The file /etc/ipf.rules has a
simple yet powerful syntax. Here we deal with the most common ways of usage,
for a more strict definition see man 5 ipf. Here is assumed xl0 as the
external interface to internet, on this one uses to have more rules than
internal interfaces.
</p>

<p>
Configurations usually start letting everything come and go, and then
apply the necesary rules to block offending packets. So this is first:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
pass out from any to any
pass in from any to any 
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Now lets block any incoming connection to port 82 tcp (eg. there's an
internal network report agent using http running on several hosts):
</p>

<p>
<pre>
block in on xl0 proto tcp from any to any port = 82
</pre>
</p>

<p>
This rule means:
</p>

<p>
"Block all incoming packets on xl0 interface whose protocol is TCP no
matter destination/origin using port 82"
</p>

<p>
If you want to log all rejected packets add "log" after "block in", or
"log quick" if you don't want it to send a message to every console root is
logged in.
</p>

<p>
Also a typical rule is to block rpc portmap:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
block in log on xl0 proto udp from any to any port = sunrpc
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<h3>IPNAT</h3>
</p>

<p>
Based on RFC 1631, ipnat provides an easy way to map internal networks on
a range of external addresses. This is very useful if you don't have
officially asigned addresses for every host on your internal network. When
you set up private/internal networks you can take advantage of reserved
address blocks like:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
10.0.0.0, 192.168.0.0, and 172.16.0.0
</pre>
</p>

<p>
If you have an internal network using 192.168.0.0 and you want to give
them access to internet using OpenBSD (of course!) and a ppp connection using
address 200.1.2.3, use this rule:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
map ppp0 192.168.0.0/16 -> 200.1.2.3/32
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Note the /16 and /32, this means:
</p>

<p>
"Any outgoing connection whose comming from an address matching the first
16 bits of 192.168.0.0 should be mapped on local address 200.1.2.3 (only one
address since /32 means every bit)"
</p>

<p>
But here arises a problem. You are assigning a lot of addresses to only
ona (or a few) address. The way to go arount it is to map TCP and UDP ports to
a certain range with the option "portmap". But remember ICMP doesnt work this
way, it only has an ID field (usually based on process number). So now its
like this:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
map ppp0 192.168.0.0/16 -> 200.1.2.3/32 portmap tcp/udp 1024:65000
map ppp0 192.168.0.0/16 -> 200.1.2.3/32
</pre>
</p>

<p>
This way things work better. If you have a dynamic address assignment
(like regular dialup modem account), you can do this:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
map ppp0 192.168.0.0/16 -> ppp0/32 portmap tcp/udp 1024:65000
map ppp0 192.168.0.0/16 -> ppp0/32<br>
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Redirecting ports</h3>
</p>

<p>
This is another very handy feature of IPNAT. If you have a host on the
internal network (using private addresses), and you want to let incoming
connections to it, you just need a simple redirect rule. For example, if you
have a web server on internal network at 10.2.2.7 listening on port 80, and 
want it to be accesible from the outside simply redirecting external IP 
120.2.3.4 on xl0, just add this rule to <kbd>/etc/ipnat.rules:</kbd>
</p>

<p>
<pre>
rdr xl0 120.2.3.4 port 80 -> 10.2.2.7 port 80
</pre>
</p>

<p>
This is a little graph:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
Internet <--> (xl0) OpenBSD (xl1) <--> LAN <--> 10.2.2.7
            128.2.3.4      whatever  10.2.2.0   Web server
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Remember to activate kernel must have option IP FORWARDING. Also remember that
EVERY packet MUST pass through the OpenBSD box, i.e. you can't redirect ports
to hosts on the same network and address external to the OpenBSD box.

<h2>6.5 - PPP </h2>
</p>

<p>
PPP is generally an easy thing to set up.  What follows is a basic intro based
on the information provided in <kbd>/etc/ppp</kbd> and the
<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ppp&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">
ppp(8)</a> manual pages. These are highly suggested reading before attempting
to setup PPP or even reading this FAQ entry.  If you have read these the 
following should look farmiliar because it is that info with a little bit of
elaboration.
</p>

<p>
First you will need to find out a little bit about how your ISP sets up its
PPP connections. Does it use scripted login, PAP, CHAP, do you have a dynamic
or static IP etc. This along with some basic info about your modem will allow
us to easily create a PPP dial in script for your ISP.
</p>

<p>
First we will create a PPP conf using what is already in 
<kbd>/etc/ppp/ppp.conf.sample</kbd> as a guide. The first section we come
to is the section labeled default. This is the best place to specify logging
options, your modem device and dial options. It will always be executed when
ppp is run. The following is the default section that comes standard with
<kbd>/etc/ppp/ppp.conf.sample</kbd> and an explanation of what each
parameter does:
</p>

<strong>&lt;Default Section&gt;</strong>
<pre>
default:
set log Phase Chat LCP IPCP CCP tun command      #This parameter tells PPP to log output which pertains 
						 #to the arguments you give the parameter.

set device /dev/cua01				 #This will set the default modem device on the system 
						 #which here is comm 2.

set speed 115200				 #This parameter sets the speed of the serial device.

set dial "ABORT BUSY ABORT NO\\sCARRIER TIMEOUT 5 \"\" AT OK-AT-OK ATE1Q0 OK \\dATDT\\T TIMEOUT 40 CONNECT"
						 #This will set the commands to follow when certian actions 
						 #take place while dialing.  Abort the call if the number is 
						 #busy, abort the call if there is no carrier.  Wait 5 seconds for 
						 #carrier. Issue AT and wait for response. If AT is ok then dial the 
						 #number and timeout if not connected in 40 seconds. Once dialed
						 #in wait for the CONNECT message to tell us we are connected.
</pre>

<p>
Now that the default modem options are set we will need to create a section
in the ppp.conf for our ISP.  Below are a few examples of what could be in
there and what type of isp they are tailored for.
</p>

<strong>&lt;MyISP Section&gt;</strong>

<pre>
myisp:
set phone 1234567			 #This of course sets the number to dial for your isp.

set login "ABORT NO\\sCARRIER TIMEOUT 5 ogin:--ogin: ppp word: ppp"
					 #This sets the login options.  It will abort login if
					 #there is no carrier with a timeout of 5 seconds.  It 
					 #will then wait for the login: prompt and send
					 #your login name, and then it will wait for the password 
					 #prompt and send your password.

set timeout 120				 #This sets the timeout for the entire login process.

set ifaddr 10.0.0.1/0 10.0.0.2/0 255.255.255.0 0.0.0.0
					 #This will set the ip address you expect your your side 
					 #and for the remote side of the connection. The /0 bit 
					 #tells the connection that no bits of this ip address 
					 #need to match and the whole thing can be replaced. 
					 #This also sets your default netmask and gateway.

add default HISADDR			 #This will make the default gateway the remote end of 
					 #the ppp connection.

enable dns				 #This tells ppp to ask the peer for the nameserver 
					 #addresses that should be used. This isnt always supported, 
					 #but if it is /etc/resolv.conf will automatically be updated.
</pre>

<strong>&lt;Pap/Chap Section&gt;</strong>
<p>
What if your ISP uses PAP or CHAP? Here is a configuration that will work
with both PAP or CHAP, PPP will decide which it needs to use.
</p>


<pre>
myispPAPCHAP:
set PHONE 1234567			 #This line sets the phone number.

set LOGIN				 #PPP will be waiting for the peer to suggest the use of 
					 #either PAP or CHAP.

set authname MyName			 #This is where you specify your username.

set authkey MyKey			 #This is where you specify your password.

set timeout 120				 #This sets the login timeout to 120 seconds.
</pre>

<p>
And then procede with the standard commands from above.
</p>

<strong>&lt;Static Ip Section&gt;</strong>
<p>
All you need to do is change the ifaddr parameter like so:
<p>

<p>
<pre>
set ifaddr 209.115.93.18 209.115.93.20
</pre>
</p>

<p>
In this example, your ip is 209.115.93.18, and the peer side ip is
209.115.93.20.
