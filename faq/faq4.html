<h2>4.1 - Installing from the OpenBSD CD</h2>
</p>

<p>
Installing from a CD is definatly the BEST choice, but first you must have purchased a cd.
You can obtain a cd from 
<a href= "../orders.html">
          http://www.openbsd.org/orders.html</a>.
If you are using either the i386, SPARC or Alpha platforms you can boot
directly off the CD. If not, you will have to create a bootdisk. You can get the
boot disk from
<kbd>ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.5/$ARCH/floppy25.fs</kbd>
</p>

<p>
To create this boot disk, use either the unix tool 
<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dd&apropos=0&sektion=1&format=html">
dd(1)</a> or MSDOS rawrite from the tools directory on the cd. Rawrite
doesnt work if you are an NT user, so you can also use
<strong>fdimage</strong> or <strong>ntrw.exe</strong> which are both also
in the tools directory.
</p>
<p>
To use dd, do the following:<br>
<pre>
# dd if=floppy25.fs of=/dev/fd0a 
</pre>
or to whichever device you want to write the floppy binary to.
</p>
<p>
After that is completed, boot from your media of choice, (cdrom or bootdisk)
and answer the questions accordingly. Here is an example installation.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<h2>4.2 - Installation via FTP</h2>
</p>

<p>
The ftp installation is almost the same as the normal installation. The same
bootdisk will be used.
</p>

<p>
<strong>floppy25.fs</strong>
</p>

<p>
Just like the CD install you will set up your disk, then when you specify
install media you choose (f)tp. You must take care to give the proper settings
when you are asked to configure your network. Have handy, your ipaddress
(see below for dhcp), netmask, nameserver addresses, and default route.
Once your network is configured correctly, you must choose the (f)tp
installation option. You will be asked a few simple questions about proxys
and passive or active transfers, and the you will be presented with a list of
ftp servers.  Select the one closest to you, and your on your way.
</p>

<h2>4.3 - Installation via DHCP</h2> 
</p>

<p>
Installation via DHCP is the same as ftp, except your system will use DHCP
to configure your network.  When you arrive at the network config option,
choose DHCP and your network will be setup accordingly.  The all you have
to do is follow the remainder of the directions from ftp install above
and you will be set.
</p>

<h2>4.4 - What files are needed for Installation?</h2>
</p>

<p>
There are many packages containing the OpenBSD binaries, but which ones do
you need to get your system up and running? Here is an overview of each
package.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>base25.tar.gz</strong> - Has the BASE OpenBSD system 
                                         *NEEDED*</li>
    <li><strong>etc25.tar.gz</strong> - Has all the files in /etc *NEEDED*</li>

<h2>4.5 - Using the OpenBSD disklabel</h2>
</p>

<p>
Be sure to check the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">disklabel(8)</a>
man page! 
</p>
<p>
Disklabel is used to identify disk's and/or partitions. The main idea behind
them is abstraction of disk hardware, since there exists several partitioning
tables. A <b>disklabel</b> is a universal partitioning table. These
labels tell the system everything about the disk, from the Maker to rpm's to
track-to-track seek. This label resides on the beginning of the disk, this isto help
bootstrap code use them (since most ROM based booting reads the first sectors of the first disk). It also will show you partitions and their types on
your disk. Disklabel can, on some systems, be used to install bootstrap
code.
</p>
<p>
As an additional gain, using disklabels helps overcome architecture limitations
on disk partitioning. For example on i386 you can only have 4 primary
partitions, with <b>disklabel</b> you can put several labels on one partition
(eg. 'swap', '/', '/usr' and '/var'). And you still have 3 more partitions
available for other OSs!
</p>
<p>
You can think of them as 'subpartitions' for installation purposes. But they
are a necesity for kernel disk access based on geometry. And remember to use
'b' for the swap label, and 'a' for root filesystem (default names in kernel).
</p>
<p>
To just view the current disklabel for your disk just do:<br>
<strong># disklabel &lt disk-device name &gt</strong><br>
This will give output similar to this:<br>
<pre>
# using MBR partition 3: type A6 off 64 (0x40) size 16777152 (0xffffc0)
# /dev/rwd0c:
type: ESDI
disk: 
label: TOSHIBA MK2720FC
flags:
bytes/sector: 512
sectors/track: 63
tracks/cylinder: 16
sectors/cylinder: 1008
cylinders: 2633
total sectors: 2654064
rpm: 3600
interleave: 1
trackskew: 0
cylinderskew: 0
headswitch: 0           # milliseconds
track-to-track seek: 0  # milliseconds
drivedata: 0 

16 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize   cpg]
  a:  2071440    65583    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl.   65*- 2120)
  b:    65520       63      swap                        # (Cyl.    0*- 65)
  c:  2654064        0    unused        0     0         # (Cyl.    0 - 2632)
  j:   512001  2137023    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl. 2120*- 2627*)
</PRE>
</p>
<p> 
In this example, there are 4 labels - A, B, C, J. A is one main partition, B is swap, and J is another partition.
C in all cases represents the full disk. This is helpful in showing what valuses in size, cyl, etc you have to work with. But with this
command you cannot change any values, you can just view. 
</p>
<p>
To be able to edit your label's interactivly you would use the <b>-E</b> flag.<br>
Example:<br> 
<pre>
# disklabel -E wd0
# using MBR partition 3: type A6 off 64 (0x40) size 16777152 (0xffffc0)

Treating sectors 64-16777216 as the OpenBSD portion of the disk.
You can use the 'b' command to change this.

Initial label editor (enter '?' for help at any prompt)

Available commands:
        p [unit]  - print label.
        M         - show entire OpenBSD man page for disklabel.
        e         - edit drive parameters.
        a [part]  - add new partition.

        m [part]  - modify existing partition.
        r         - recalculate free space.
        u         - undo last change.
        s [path]  - save label to file.
        w         - write label to disk.
        q         - quit and save changes.
        x         - exit without saving changes.
        ? [cmnd]  - this message or command specific help.
Numeric parameters may use suffixes to indicate units:
        'b' for bytes, 'c' for cylinders, 'k' for kilobytes, 'm' for megabytes,
        'g' for gigabytes or no suffix for sectors (usually 512 bytes).
        Non-sector units will be rounded to the nearest cylinder.
Entering '?' at most prompts will give you (simple) context sensitive help.

No changes.

</p>
<p>
In this example we get into disklabel's interactive mode. From here we can issue the command "?" asking for help.
This gives us many commands we can use to add, delete, edit existing
labels. 
</p>
<p>
There is a new feature on disklabel, to help installation. The '-f' flag
writes a 'fstab' like file, if given a mount point for a label. This is only
used at installation.

<h2>4.6 - Using fdisk</h2>
</p>

<p>
First be sure to check the fdisk main page. 
<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">fdisk(8)</a>
</p>
<p>
Fdisk is a program to help with the maintenance of your partitions. This
program is used at install time to set up your OpenBSD partition (this
partition can contain <u>several</u> labels, each with filesystems/swap/etc.).
It can divide space on your drives and set one active. This program will
usually be used in Single User Mode ( boot -s ). Fdisk also sets the MBR on
your various hard disks.
</p>

<p>
For installation purposes, most times you'll only need <b>ONE</b> Openbsd
partition, and then using disklabel to put a swap and a filesystem on it.
</p>

<p>
To just view your partition table using fdisk just use:<br>
<strong># fdisk fd0</strong><br>
Which will give an output similar to this:<br>
<pre>
         Disk: fd0       geometry: 80/2/18 [2880 sectors]
         Offset: 0       Signatures: 0xAA55,0x0
                  Starting        Ending
          #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
         *0: A6    0   0   1 -   79   1  18 [         0 -       2880] OpenBSD
          1: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused
          2: A7    0   0   2 -   79   1  18 [         1 -       2879] NEXTSTEP
          3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused
</pre>
</p>
<p>
In this example we are viewing the fdisk output of floppy drive. We can
see the OpenBSD partition (A6) and its size. The * tells us that the
OpenBSD partition is a bootable partition.
</p>
<p>
In the previous example we just viewed our information. What if we want to
edit our partition table? Well, to do so we must use the <b>-e</b> flag.
This will bring up a command line prompt to interact with fdisk.
</p>
<p>
<PRE>
# fdisk -e wd0
Enter 'help' for information
fdisk: 1> help
        help            Command help list
        manual          Show entire OpenBSD man page for fdisk
        reinit          Re-initialize loaded MBR (to defaults)
        disk            Edit current drive stats
        edit            Edit given table entry
        flag            Flag given table entry as bootable
        update          Update machine code in loaded MBR
        select          Select extended partition table entry MBR
        print           Print loaded MBR partition table
        write           Write loaded MBR to disk
        exit            Exit edit of current MBR, without saving changes
        quit            Quit edit of current MBR, saving current changes
        abort           Abort program without saving current changes
fdisk: 1> 
 
</PRE>
</p>
<p> It is perfectly safe in fdisk to go in and explore, just make sure to
answer <Strong>N</strong> to saving the changes and *DON'T* use the
<strong>write</strong> command.
</p>
<p>Here is an overview of the commands you can use when you choose the
<b>-e</b> flag.<br>
<ul>
<li><strong>help</strong>    Display a list of commands that fdisk understands in the interactive edit mode.</li>
<li><strong>reinit</strong>  Initialize the currently selected, in-memory copy of the boot block.</li>
<li><strong>disk</strong>    Display the current drive geometry that fdisk has probed. You are given a chance to edit it if you wish.</li>
<li><strong>edit</strong>    Edit a given table entry in the memory copy of the current boot block.  You may edit either in BIOS geometry mode, or in sector offsets and sizes.</li>
<li><strong>flag</strong>    Make the given partition table entry
bootable. Only one entry can be marked bootable. If you wish to boot from
an extended partition, you will need to mark the partition table entry for
the extended partition as bootable.</li>
<li><strong>update</strong>  Update the machine code in the memory copy of
the currently selected boot block.</li>
<li><strong>select</strong>  Select and load into memory the boot block
pointed to by the extended partition table entry in the current boot block.</li>
<li><strong>print</strong>   Print the currently selected in-memory copy
of the boot block and its MBR table to the terminal.</li>
<li><strong>write</strong>   Write the in-memory copy of the boot block to
disk. You will be asked to confirm this operation.</li>
<li><strong>exit</strong>    Exit the current level of fdisk, either
returning to the previously selected in-memory copy of a boot block, or exiting the
program if there is none.</li>
<li><strong>quit</strong>    Exit the current level of fdisk, either
returning to the previously selected in-memory copy of a boot block, or exiting the
program if there is none.  Unlike exit it does write the modified block out.</li>
<li><strong>abort</strong>   Quit program without saving current changes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4.7 - Adding new disks in OpenBSD</h2>
</p>

<p>
Well once you get your disk installed <strong>PROPERLY</strong> you need to use
<a href=
"http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">
fdisk(8)</a> and 
<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">
disklabel(8)</a> to set up your disk in OpenBSD. Making sure that the partition
ID is 'A6'. Once you have done this, OpenBSD will be able to recognize the new
disk, and you need to create the filesystem on that disk using 
<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=newfs&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">
newfs(8)</a>.
</p>

<p>
<kbd>bsd# newfs wd1a </kbd>
</p>

<p>
or so on using OpenBSD's disk numbering scheme
<pre>
  wd0
  wd1
  wd2
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Edit fstab to mount the new disk at a mount point of your choice, and reboot.
</p>

<p>
If you need to migrate an existing directory like /usr/bin. You should mount 
the new drive in /mnt and use cpio -pdum to copy /usr/bin to the /mnt directory.
Edit the /etc/fstab file to show that /usr/bin will be mounted on the new drive.
example:
</p>

<p>
<strong>/dev/wd1a /usr/bin ffs rw 1 1</strong>
</p>

<p>
Reboot into single user mode..<strong>boot -s</strong> Move the existing
/usr/bin to /usr/bin-backup and create an empty /usr/bin. Then reboot the
system, and whala!! the files are there!
</p>

<br>

<h2>4.8 - How do I swap to a file?</h2>
</p>

<p>
With OpenBSD 2.5 came the introduction of <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=swapctl&sektion=8&format=html">swapctl(8)</a>, 
which made dealing with swap devices much easier. Swapping to a file doesn't require a 
custom built kernel, But that can still be done, this faq will show you how to add 
swap space both ways.
</p>

<p>
To swap to a file permanently, first make a kernel with vnd0c as swap. If you 
have wd0a as root filesystem, wd0b is the previous swap, use this line in the 
kernel configuration file (refer to compiling a new kernel if in doubt):
</p>

<p>
<pre>
config          bsd     root on wd0a swap on wd0b and vnd0c dumps on wd0b
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Second make the file for swap. If you want a 32MB swapfile named /newswap do:
</p>

<p>
<strong># dd if=/dev/zero of=/newswap bs=1k count=32768</strong>
</p>

<p>
Add a line to your /etc/fstab file to indicate where the new swap will be.
</p>

<p>
<strong>/dev/vnd0c none sw 0 0</strong>
</p>

<p>
Now boot with the new kernel. Then create the vnd0 device to use that file
as a device:
</p>

<p>
<strong># vnconfig -c -v vnd0 /newswap</strong>
</p>

<p>
And add it now to swap:
</p>

<p>
<strong># swapon /dev/vnd0c</strong>
</p>

<p>
You can now see if it is working with:
</p>

<p>
<strong># pstat -s</strong>
</p>

<h2>4.9 - Softupdates</h2>
<p>
<strong>
Softupdates are experimental and are NOT recomended for regular users.
</strong>
</p>

<p>
Over the last few years Krik McKusick has been working on something called
"soft updates". This is based on an idea proposed by Greg Ganger and Yale
Patt that imposing a partial ordering on the buffer cache opertions would
permit the requirement for synchronous writing of directory entries to be
removed from the FFS code. Thus, a large performance increase of disk
writing performance.
</p>

<p>
To enable Softupdates your kernel must have option
</p>

<p>
<strong>option FFS_SOFTUPDATES</strong>
</p>

<p>
then you need to boot into single-user mode:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
boot>boot -s
[snip]
bsd# tunefs -s enable &lt;raw device&gt;
bsd# reboot -n
</pre>
</p>

<p>
GOOD LUCK. Please direct all problem reports with as MUCH information as
possible (kernel coredumps, tracebacks, etc) to <a href="mailto:csapuntz@openbsd.org">Costa</a>. 
Do not waste his time with any other questions or incomplete problem
reports.

<h2> 4.10 - How much space do I need for an OpenBSD installation?</h2>

</pre>
</p>

<p>
When you are in the disklabel editor, you may choose to make your entire
system have just an 'a' and 'b' partition.  The 'a' partition you set up
in disklabel will become your root partition, which should be the sum of
all the 3 main values above (/, /usr, and /var) plus some space for /tmp.
The 'b' partition you set up automatically becomes your system swap
partition -- we recommend a minimum of 32MB but if you have disk to spare
make it at least 64MB.
</p>

<p>
However, we recommend you use many seperate partitions so that users
cannot fill up your important partitions as easily, thus causing nasty denial
of service problems.  If you are extra cautious, you will make at least the
following seperate partitions: / swap /usr /var /tmp /var/tmp /home.

<h2>4.11 - How do I get rid of in "partition 3 id 0" error on boot?</h2>
</p>

<p>
This means that your MBR (Master Boot Record) was not installed properly
or that your BIOS is not compatible with your current MBR. To solve this
first try to reinstall the OpenBSD boot blocks. To do so use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=installboot&sektion=8&format=html">intsallboot(8)</a>.
For example, the most common usage is:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Boot from the OpenBSD bootdisk</li>
<ul>
<li># fsck /dev/rwd0a && mount /dev/wd0a /mnt </li>
<li># cp /usr/mdec/boot /mnt/boot</li>
<li># /usr/mdec/installboot -v /mnt/boot /usr/mdec/biosboot wd0</li>
</ul>
<li>Here substitute your disk devices for rwd0a & wd0a. This will install the boot blocks again.</li>
<li>Then Reboot.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If this doesn't work you still have a few more options. So, luck hasn't
run out yet. The first is to use a bootloader such as OS-BS. The OpenBSD
cd has the os-bs bootloader included in the tools directory. If you didn't
purchase a CD-ROM, you can download os-bs from any of the OpenBSD ftp
sites.
</p>

<p>
<kbd>pub/OpenBSD/2.5/tools/osbs135.exe</kbd>
</p>

<p>
and take some time to look through the web pages at
<a href= "http://www.prz.tu-berlin.de/~wolf/os-bs.html">
          http://www.prz.tu-berlin.de/~wolf/os-bs.html</a>
</p>

<p>
There are also other commercial bootloaders or lilo that you can use for
multi-booting.
</p>

<p>
Here is a simple outline of how to get lilo onto your system.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Boot a DOS floppy and do a fdisk /MBR. Make sure you do that on the
drive you'll be booting from.</li>
<li>Boot from a linux disk and install LILO & chain it to your OpenBSD
boot block.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4.12 - How do I get a <i>dmesg</i> from a boot floppy?</h2>
</p>

<p>
RAMDISK images (boot floppies) do not ship with the <i>dmesg</i> utility.
They do, however, have the <code>/kern</code> filesystem mounted. To copy 
the dmesg information to a file, do a:
</p>

<pre>
# cat /kern/msgbuf >mydmesg
</pre>

<h2>4.13 - Installing bootblocks (i386 specific)</h2>
</p>  
<p>
PC BIOS's can only deal with disk geometries with 1024 cylinders
or less.  Since most disks these days have more than 1024
cylinders, most PC scsi controllers "translate" the real disk
geometry into something that fits within the BIOS's parameters.
However, not all scsi controllers "translate" the geometry in
the same way.  If you change scsi controllers and they use a
different "translated" geometry you will be unable to load the
second stage boot loader (and thus unable to load the kernel)
because the first stage boot loader contains a list of the blocks
that comprise /boot in terms of the "translated" geometry.  To
fix this, just boot from a boot floppy and at the boot prompt,
type "b hd0a:/bsd" to boot from the first hard disk (and not the
floppy).  Your machine should come up normally.  You now need
to update the first stage boot loader (aka the boot block). This is
also the same way to for any disk device, ide disks and scsi disks in
OpenBSD. 
<br>
To do this, assuming your boot disk is sd0:
</p>
<pre>
cd /usr/mdec; ./installboot /boot biosboot sd0
</pre>

<strong>OpenBSD & NT</strong>
</p>

<p>
To multiboot OpenBSD and NT, you can use NTloader. The bootloader the NT uses. To multi-boot with NT, you
need a copy of your OpenBSD pbr. After running installboot, you can copy it something like this:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
# dd if=/dev/rsd0a of=openbsd.pbr count=1
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Now boot NT and put openbsd.pbr in c:. Add a line like this to the end of c:\boot.ini: 
</p>

<p>
<pre>
c:\openbsd.pbr="OpenBSD"
</pre>
</p>

<p>
When you reboot, you should be able to select OpenBSD from the NT loader menu. There is much more
information available about NTloader at the <a href="http://www.dorsai.org/~dcl/publications/NTLDR_Hacking/">
NTLDR Hacking Guide. </a>
</p>

<p>
<strong>OpenBSD & Windows or DOS</strong>
</p>

<p>
To boot OpenBSD along with Windows 3.1, Windows95, or DOS you must simply put a boot loader on the system
that can handle these OS's. Some bootloaders of choice are <a href="http://www.freebird.org/sw-map/bootmanager.html">
osbs20b8.zip</a> or <a href="http://www.users.intercom.com/~ranish/part/">The Ranish Partition Manager</a>.
Both of these are known to be able to boot OpenBSD partitions.

<strong>OpenBSD & Linux</strong>

Please refer to <a href="INSTALL.linux">INSTALL.linux</a>, which gives indepth instructions on getting
OpenBSD working with Linux.
