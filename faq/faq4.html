<h2>4.1 - Overview of the OpenBSD installation procedure</h2>
</p>

<p>
This FAQ now contains installation instructions for OpenBSD 2.8. There
may be differences between the 2.8 installation and installation of earlier
versions of OpenBSD.
</p>

<p>
OpenBSD has a very robust text-based install procedure. The OpenBSD install
procedure was designed to be adaptable in almost any situation that a user
could face. In addition to its robustness, the install procedure can be done
using 1 floppy disk. Each architecture's installation procedure is very
similar, however a different set of tools will often be required. Below we
will outline the different options that an OpenBSD user has when installing
the system.
</p>

<p>
The following information is architecture independent. Please refer to each
architectures installation page or the OpenBSD CD cover for architecture 
dependent installation information.
</p>

<h3>4.1.1 - Supported OpenBSD Architectures</h3>

<p>
OpenBSD 2.9 supports X architectures listed below in alphabetical order.

<h3>4.1.2 - Supported Installation Media</h3>

<p>
OpenBSD has the ability to install from multiple media types. The most
common and architecture independent options are laid out below. These
options can be used after booting from either an OpenBSD CD-ROM or floppy
disk. More information on <a href="#4.1.3">creating OpenBSD installdisks </a>
is located later in this FAQ.
</p>

<table align="center" border="1" width="800">
	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>CD-ROM</b>
		</td>
		<td bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
			To do a CD-ROM install, you must have either purchased an

<h3>4.1.3 - Creating bootable OpenBSD install floppies.</h3>

<p>
To create an installation floppy image you must first download the correct boot
floppy image from one of the OpenBSD distribution sites. You can find a list of FTP servers
at the <a href="../ftp.html">OpenBSD FTP Distribution</a> page. Each architecture
has one floppy image for download except the <a href="../i386.html">i386</a> platform, 
which has 3 images to choose from. The differences between the i386 platform installation
floppies will be outlined below. For the other architectures you will just need to
download the respective <i>floppy28.fs</i> image. <br>
<b>NOTE:</b> The <i>cdrom28.fs</i> image can be used to make a bootable OpenBSD installation
CD-ROM.
</p>

<p>
The i386 platform has 3 separate installation disks that you must choose from. The differences between
each is outlined below.

<ul>
	<li><b>floppy28.fs</b> supports the following devices XXX -
		<p>
		Ethernet:
		<ul>
			<li>NE2000 PCMCIA
			<li>3com 3c5xx PCMCIA
			<li>Xircom PCMCIA
		</ul>
		Disk:
		<ul>
			<li>ISAPNP/PCMCIA IDE (<i>all floppy images support ISA and PCI IDE</i>)
			<li>BusLogic [57]4X SCSI
			<li>Adaptec 154[02] SCSI
			<li>Adaptec 174[024] SCSI
			<li>Adaptec 274X/284X/2940 SCSI
			<li>NCR 538XX SCSI
			<li>AdvanSys 1200A/B/Ultra/Ultrawide SCSI
			<li>Seagate ST0[12] SCSI
		</ul>
		<p>
		<li><b>floppyB28.fs</b> supports the following devices not supported by floppy28.fs:
		<p>
		Disk:
		<ul>
			<li>Qlogic ISP [12]0x0 SCSI/FibreChannel
			<li>UltraStor [123]4f SCSI
			<li>WD7000/TMC-7000 SCSI
		</ul>
		<p>
		<li><b>floppyC28.fs</b> supports Cardbus and PCIBIOS.
		<p>
		Ethernet:
		   <ul>
			<li>3Com 3C575TX, 3C[CX]FE575BT, and 3C[CX3]FE575CT CardBus 
			<li>3Com 3C[CX]FEM656, 3C[CX]FEM656B, and 3C[CX3]FEM656C CardBus 
			<li>ADMtek AN985 Centaur-C CardBus 
			<li>IBM EtherJet 10/100 CardBus 
			<li>Intel PRO/100 CardBus II 
		   </ul>
		<p>
</ul>

<p>
Most i386 users will just use the <i>floppy28.fs</i> installation floppy.
</p>

<p>
Once you have the correct floppy image, you need to get a clean floppy disk.
If there are ANY bad sectors on the floppy disk, the installation will most
likely fail. If you don't know, use the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdformat&sektion=0">fdformat(1)</a>
command to both format and check for bad sectors.
</p>

<ul>
<table border=0 width="800">
	<tr>
		<td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
# <b>fdformat /dev/fd0a</b><br>
Format 1440K floppy `/dev/fd0a'? (y/n): y<br>
Processing VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV done.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</ul>

<p>
If your output is like the above example, then your disk is OK. However, if you do not see
ALL &quot;V&quot;'s then your disk is most likely bad, and you should try a new one. If you
are formatting in MS-DOS, simply use the DOS <i>format</i> command.
</p>

<p>
Once you have a clean, formatted floppy it is time to write the installation image to
floppy. If you are creating this on an OpenBSD machine or another UNIX-like OS, you can 
use the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dd&sektion=0">dd(1)</a> utility.
an example usage of dd(1) is below:
</p>

<ul>
<table border=0 width="800">
        <tr>
                <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
# <b>dd if=floppy28.fs of=/dev/rfd0c bs=126b</b>
                </td>
        </tr>
</table>
</ul>

<p>
Once the image is written, check to make sure that the copied image is the same as the
original with the following command. If the test passes, you will just see another prompt.
</p>

<ul>
<table border=0 width="800">
        <tr>
                <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
# <b>cmp /dev/rfd0c floppy28.fs</b>
                </td>
        </tr>
</table>
</ul>

<p>
Again, if you are creating this image on the Windows/DOS platform you can get tools from the
<a href="ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/tools/">tools</a> directory on
any of the ftp mirrors, or in <b>2.8/tools</b> directory on CD1 on the OpenBSD CD.
For users of Windows, <i>rawrite</i> will be all you need to write your boot floppy.
</p>

<ul>
Example usage of <i>rawrite</i>:
<table border=0 width="800">
        <tr>
                <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
C:\> <b>rawrite</b><br>
RaWrite 1.2 - Write disk file to raw floppy diskette<br><br>

Enter source file name: <b>floppy28.fs</b><br>
Enter destination drive: <b>a</b><br>
Please insert a formatted diskette into drive A: and press -ENTER- : <b>&gt;Enter&lt;</b>
                </td>
        </tr>
</table>
</ul>

<p>
If you use NT, rawrite will not work for you. You can, however, use
<i>fdimage</i> or <i>ntrw</i> to write the boot floppy. Both of which
are available on the ftp sites (linked above), or the OpenBSD CD. Here are
example usages for each program.
</p>

<ul>
Example Usage of <i>fdimage</i>:
<table border=0 width="800">
        <tr>
                <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
C:\> <strong>fdimage -q floppy28.fs a:</strong>
                </td>
        </tr>
</table>

Example Usage of <i>ntrw</i>:
<table border=0 width="800">
        <tr>
                <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">

        </tr>

</ul>

<h3>4.1.4 - Booting OpenBSD Installation Images.</h3>

<p>
This section is initially broken down into architecture dependent
sections for popular architectures that OpenBSD supports. This is
so we can properly instruct each user on the what to do on their
respective platform.
</p>

<h4>Booting i386</h4>

<ul>
<p>
Booting an install image on the i386 architecture is nothing
new to most people. If you are using the floppy disk, simply stick
the floppy into your floppy drive and boot your system. Your install
image will automatically load. If you are planning on booting from CD,
you must go into your systems BIOS and set the boot options to allow
booting from CD. Some older BIOSs do not have this option, and you
must use a floppy for booting your installation image. Don't worry though,
even if you boot from floppy you can still install from the CD.
</p>
</ul>

<h4>Booting sparc</h4>

<ul>
<p>
To boot from floppy, place your floppy disk with the OpenBSD installation
image on it into your floppy drive. Then use the following command to 
boot from your floppy:
</p>

<ul>
<table border=0 width="800">
        <tr>
                <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
ok <b>boot floppy</b>
                </td>
        </tr>
</table>
</ul>

<p>
To boot from CD-ROM, place your OpenBSD CD-ROM disk into your drive.
If your Sun only has one CD-ROM drive, then just go to the boot prompt,
where you can '<tt>boot cdrom</tt>':
</p>

<ul>
<table border=0 width="800">
        <tr>
                <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
ok <b>boot cdrom</b>
                </td>
        </tr>
</table>
</ul>

<p>
Of course, this will only work in new command mode.  If you are at the 
old command mode prompt (a right arrow), type 'n' for the new command mode.
(If you are using an old sparc that is pre-sun4c, you probably don't have
a new command mode.  In this case, you need to experiment.)
If you have multiple CD-ROM devices, you need to boot from the correct one.
Try <tt>probe-scsi</tt> from the new command mode.
</p>

<ul>
<table border=0 width="800">
        <tr>
                <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
ok <b>probe-scsi</b><br>
Target 0<br>
  Unit 0   Disk     QUANTUM LIGHTNING 365S<br>
Target 1<br>
  Unit 0   Removable Disk     QUANTUM EMPIRE_1080S<br>
Target 3<br>
  Unit 0   Removable Disk     Joe's CD ROMs<br>
                </td>
        </tr>
</table>
</ul>

<p>
Figure out which disk is the CD ROM you want to boot from.  Note the
target number.
</p>

<ul>
<table border=0 width="800">
        <tr>
                <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
ok <b>boot /sbus/esp/sd@X,0</b>
                </td>
        </tr>
</table>
</ul>

<p>
Now that your bootdisk has been created, it's time to boot it.
When you boot this floppy, the kernel and all of the programs
that OpenBSD uses to install itself are loaded into memory.  If problems arise,
and your bootdisk doesn't boot, the problem is probably due to a
bad floppy disk. This is an extremely common problem!  If your bootdisk fails
to boot, try it a second time, and if it fails again, throw away the floppy
and get a new one.  When your floppy fails to boot, even if the floppy worked
fine for you before, keep in mind that OpenBSD uses nearly every single
bit available from the floppy!
Any error in the disk will prevent OpenBSD from loading.
</p>

<p>
When your boot is successful, you will see a lot of white on blue text,
that text is the kernel telling you what devices have been found,
and where.  Then, you will see the following:
</p>

<ul>
<table border=0 width="800">
        <tr>
                <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
rootdev=0x1100 rrootdev=0x2f00 rawdev=0x2f02<br>
Enter pathname of shell or RETURN for sh:<br>
erase ^?, werase ^W, kill ^U, intr ^C<br>
(I)nstall, (U)pgrade or (S)hell? <b>i</b><br>
==================================================<br>
Welcome to the OpenBSD/i386 2.8 installation program.<br><br>

This program is designed to help you put OpenBSD on your disk in a simple and<br>
rational way.<br><br>

As with anything which modifies your disk's contents, this program can cause<br>
SIGNIFICANT data loss, and you are advised to make sure your data is backed<br>
up before beginning the installation process.<br><br>

Default answers are displayed in brackets after the questions.  You can hit<br>
Control-C at any time to quit, but if you do so at a prompt, you may have<br>
to hit return.  Also, quitting in the middle of installation may leave your<br>
system in an inconsistent state.  If you hit Control-C and restart the<br>
install, the install program will remember many of your old answers.<br><br>

You can run a shell command at any prompt via '!foo'<br>
or escape to a shell by simply typing '!'.<br><br>

Specify terminal type [pcvt25]: <b>&lt;Enter&gt;</b>
                </td>
        </tr>
</table>
</ul>

<p>
Depending on the architecture you are using, the terminal type you use might 
be different. For example, OpenBSD/sparc uses the &quot;sun&quot; terminal type.
</p>
</ul>

<h3>4.1.5 - Setting up disks during installation.</h3>

<p>
Setting up disk's in OpenBSD is fairly similar for each platform. For i386 disk
setup is done in two stages. One is with fdisk(8) and the other with disklabel(8).

<ul>
<table border=0 width="800">
        <tr>
                <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
The installation program needs to know which disk to consider the root disk.<br>
Note the unit number may be different than the unit number you used in the<br>
boot program (especially on a PC with multiple disk controllers).<br>
Available disks are:<br><br>

wd0<br><br>

Which disk is the root disk? [wd0] <b>&lt;Enter&gt;</b><br>
Do you want to use the *entire* disk for OpenBSD? [no] <b>yes</b><br><br>

[...]
                </td>
        </tr>
</table>
</ul>

<p>
This is the section in the install where you choose which disk you want
as your &quot;root&quot; disk. Your root disk will be where the / filesystem
and swap will be. <b>wd0</b> specifies an IDE disk, if your disks are SCSI you
will most likely see <b>sd0</b>. There should be an entry for each disk that
OpenBSD finds. If you choose to allot the whole disk to OpenBSD, the installation
program will automatically setup the diskspace for you, however if you choose not
to give the whole disk to OpenBSD you will be placed in a disk editor, 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&sektion=8&arch=i386">ie fdisk(8)</a>.
For more information on using fdisk(8), <a href="faq14.html#14.2">refer to the FAQ</a>.
</p>

<ul>
<table border=0 width="800">
        <tr>
                <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
Inside the BIOS 'A6' ('OpenBSD') partition you just created, there resides an<br>
OpenBSD partition table which defines how this BIOS partition is to be split<br>
up. This table declares the offsets and sizes of your / partition, your swap<br>
space, and any other partitions you might create.  (NOTE: The OpenBSD disk<br>
label offsets are absolute, ie. relative to the start of the disk... NOT<br>
relative to the start of the BIOS 'A6' partition).<br><br>

disklabel: no disk label<br>
WARNING: Disk wd0 has no label. You will be creating a new one.<br><br>

If this disk is shared with other operating systems, those operating systems<br>
should have a BIOS partition entry that spans the space they occupy completely.<br>
For safety, also make sure all OpenBSD file systems are within the offset and<br>
size specified in the 'A6' BIOS partition table.  (By default, the disklabel<br>
editor will try to enforce this).  If you are unsure of how to use multiple<br>
partitions properly (ie. separating /,  /usr, /tmp, /var, /usr/local, and other<br>
things) just split the space into a root and swap partition for now.<br><br>

</ul>

<p>
Notice how each mount point is split onto its own partition. For a multiuser 
machine, it is best to make at least five separate filesystems, one for 
your / filesystem, one for swap, one for /var, one for /tmp, 
and one for /usr. If your users are going to store files of any significant 
size, you want a separate /home filesystem too. 
</p>

<h3>4.1.6 - Configuring your mountpoints and formating your filesystems</h3>

<p>
There are four main reasons for using separate filesystems, instead of shoving everything into one or two filesystems: 
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> You can mark some filesystems as 'nosuid', 'nodev', 'noexec', 'readonly', etc.. 
<li><strong>Stability:</strong> A user, or a misbehaved program, can fill a filesystem with garbage, if they have write permissions for it.
Your critical programs, which of course run on a different filesystem, do not get interrupted. 
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> A filesystem which gets written to frequently may get somewhat fragmented. (Luckily, the ffs filesystem, what OpenBSD uses, is not prone to heavy fragmentation.) 
<li><strong>Integrity:</strong> If one filesystem is corrupted for some reason then your other filesystems are still OK. 
</ul>

<p>
Setting up your mountpoints is much more simple than it looks. After you setup your filesystems with disklabel, will see text like the text below. This should 
be done for you automatically if you configured mount points via disklabel(8). If you did not, you can do so here.
</p>

<ul>
<table border=0 width="800">
        <tr>
                <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
<pre>
You will now have the opportunity to enter filesystem information for wd0.
You will be prompted for the mount point (full path, including the prepending
'/' character) for each BSD partition on wd0.  Enter "none" to skip a
partition or "done" when you are finished.

The following partitions will be used for the root filesystem and swap:
        wd0a    /
        wd0b    swap

Mount point for wd0d (size=82152k) [/tmp, RET, none, or done]? <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
Mount point for wd0e (size=82152k) [/var, RET, none, or done]? <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
Mount point for wd0g (size=358344k) [/usr, RET, none, or done]? <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
Mount point for wd0h (size=39108384k) [/home, RET, none, or done]? <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
Mount point for wd0d (size=82002k) [/tmp, RET, none, or done]? done <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>

Now you can select another disk to initialize.  (Do not re-select a disk
you have already entered information for).  Available disks are:

wd0

Which one? [done] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>

You have configured the following devices and mount points:

wd0a /
wd0d /tmp
wd0e /var
wd0g /usr
wd0h /home

============================================================
The next step will overwrite any existing data on:
        wd0a wd0d wd0e wd0g wd0h

<p>
Notice this answer defaults to no, so you will have to directly tell it to format your labels. If you chose no you will simply be dropped into a shell and can start the install again by
typing install, or just rebooting again with your bootdisk. At this point it will format all filesystems for you, this could take some time depending on the size of your disk. 
</p>

<h3>4.1.7 - Configuring your Network</h3>

<p>
Now it's time to setup your network configuration. This is extremely important if you are planning on doing any network based install, considering it will be based upon the
information you are about to enter. Here is a walkthrough of the network configuration section of the install process. 
</p>

<ul>
<table border=0 width="800">
        <tr>
                <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
<pre>
You will now be given the opportunity to configure the network.  This will be
useful if you need to transfer the installation sets via FTP, HTTP, or NFS.
Even if you choose not to transfer installation sets that way, this information
will be preserved and copied into the new root filesystem.

Configure the network [y] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
Enter system hostname (short form): [] <strong>mybox</strong>
Enter DNS domain name: [] <strong>someisp.com</strong>

If you have any devices being configured by a DHCP server
it is recommended that you do not enter a default route or
any name servers.

You may configure the following network interfaces (the interfaces
marked with [X] have been successfully configured):

        [ ] fxp0

Configure which interface? (or, enter 'done') [fxp0] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
IP address (or 'dhcp') ? [] <strong>199.185.137.55</strong>
Symbolic (host) name? [test2] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
Netmask ? [255.255.255.0] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
Your use of the network interface may require non-default
media directives.  The default media is:
        media: Ethernet autoselect (100baseTX full-duplex)
This is a list of supported media:
        media autoselect
        media 100baseTX mediaopt full-duplex
        media 100baseTX
        media 10baseT mediaopt full-duplex
        media 10baseT
If the default is not satisfactory, and you wish to use another
media, copy that line from above (e.g. "media 100baseTX")
Media directives? [] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>

You may configure the following network interfaces (the interfaces
marked with [X] have been successfully configured):

        [X] fxp0
Configure which interface? (or, enter 'done') [done] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
</pre>
                </td>
        </tr>
</table>
</ul>

<p>
In the above example, we use a static IP address. You can choose to use dhcp as well if you choose. In the case of DHCP, most of this information will be grabbed from a remote dhcp server.
</p>

<ul>
<table border=0 width="800">
        <tr>
                <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
<pre>
Enter IP address of default route: [none] <strong>199.185.137.128</strong>
Enter IP address of primary nameserver: [none] <strong>199.185.137.1</strong>
Would you like to use the nameserver now? [y] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
</pre>
                </td>
        </tr>
</table>
</ul>

<h3>4.1.8 - Choosing Installation Media</h3>

<p>
After your network is setup, the install script will give you a chance to make any changes to your network setup. (Mainly if errors were produced.) Then the filesystems you
created will be mounted and a root password set. This will get your local disks ready for the OpenBSD packages to be installed upon them. After your local disks are ready you
will get a chance to choose your installation media. The options are listed below. 
</p>

<ul>
<table border=0 width="800">
        <tr>
                <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
<pre>
You will now be given the opportunity to escape to the command shell to do
any additional network configuration you may need.  This may include adding
additional routes, if needed.  In addition, you might take this opportunity
to redo the default route in the event that it failed above.
Escape to shell? [n] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>

/dev/wd0a on /mnt type ffs (rw, asynchronous, local)
/dev/wd0d on /mnt/tmp type ffs (rw, asynchronous, local)
/dev/wd0e on /mnt/var type ffs (rw, asynchronous, local)
/dev/wd0g on /mnt/usr type ffs (rw, asynchronous, local)
/dev/wd0h on /mnt/home type ffs (rw, asynchronous, local)

Please enter the initial password that the root account will have.
Password (will not echo): <strong>&lt;Your Password Here!&gt;</strong>
Password (again): <strong>&lt;Your Password Here!&gt;</strong>

Do you expect to run the X Window System? [y] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>

It is now time to extract the installation sets onto the hard disk.  Make sure
the sets are either on a local device (i.e. tape, CD-ROM) or on a network
server.  You will have the chance to repeat this step or to extract sets from
several places, so you don't have to try to load all the sets in one try and
can recover from some errors.

Install from (f)tp, (h)ttp, (t)ape, (C)D-ROM, (N)FS or local (d)isk? <strong>c</strong>
</pre>
                </td>
        </tr>
</table>
</ul>

<p>
In this example we are installing via CD-ROM. This will bring up a list of devices on your computer identified as a CD-ROM. Most
people will only have one; if you don't, you need to make sure you pick the device in which you will be installing the OpenBSD from. After choosing the correct device, you will be
prompted for which filesystem the installation files will reside on. If you are using the OpenBSD CD-ROM you will choose 'c' here, for 'c' represents the whole disk. Here is an
example: 
</p>

<ul>
<table border=0 width="800">
        <tr>
                <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
<pre>
The following CD-ROM devices are installed on your system; please make
sure the CD is in the CD-ROM drive and select the device containing
the CD with the installation sets:

cd0

Which CD-ROM contains the installation media? [cd0] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
</pre>
                </td>
        </tr>
</table>
</ul>

<p>
Now you will be prompted for which filesystem to use when reading the CD-ROM, and to what directory the installation files are. If you are using the official OpenBSD
CD-ROM, you will use 'cd9660' as your filesystem. (Which is the default.) You will then be using '/2.8/i386/' as the directory in which the files reside. (Again, this is the default
option.) After this you will get a list of packages to install. You can get a description of these files in <a href="#4.2">FAQ 4.2</a>. Here is what you will be seeing: 
</p>

<h3>4.1.9 - Choosing installation packages and finishing the install.</h3>

<p>
Now it's time to choose which packages you will be installing. You can get a description of these files in faq4.2. The files that the installdisk finds will be shown to you on the
screen. Your job is just to specify which files you want. By default only 4 packages are selected. These are 'base28.tar.gz', 'etc28.tar.gz', 'man28.tar.gz' and 'bsd'. This is because
these first 3 files MUST be present for you to have any sort of a functional system, the 'bsd' file is the kernel of the system. The rest are left up to your discretion. The example
below is that of a full install, minus the games package. 
</p>

<ul>
<table border=0 width="800">
        <tr>
                <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
<pre>
Enter the directory relative to the mount point that
contains the file. [/2.8/i386] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>

You will now be asked for files to extract.  In addition to the
files listed in the selector you may enter any file located in
/mnt2//2.8/i386.  You can also enter 'all' to install all the standard
sets, or 'list' to list the files available in /mnt2//2.8/i386.
When you are done selecting files, enter 'done'.
Some of these sets are required for your install and some are optional --
You will want at least the base and bsd sets.
Consult the installation notes if you are not sure which sets are required!

The following sets are available for extraction.
Enter filename, `list', `all', or `done'.
You may de-select a set by prepending a '-' to its name.

        [X] base28.tgz
        [X] etc28.tgz
        [ ] misc28.tgz
        [ ] comp28.tgz
        [X] man28.tgz

        [ ] xshare28.tgz
        [ ] xfont28.tgz
        [ ] xserv28.tgz
        [X] bsd
File name? [] <strong>*</strong>

The following sets are available for extraction.
Enter filename, `list', `all', or `done'.

        [X] xshare28.tgz
        [X] xfont28.tgz
        [X] xserv28.tgz
        [X] bsd
File name? [] <strong>-game*</strong>

The following sets are available for extraction.
Enter filename, `list', `all', or `done'.
You may de-select a set by prepending a '-' to its name.

        [X] base28.tgz

</ul>

<p>
Once you have successfully picked which packages you want, you will be prompted to make sure you want to extract these packages and they will then be installed. A progress
bar will be shown that will keep you informed on how much time it will take. The times range greatly depending on what system it is you are installing OpenBSD on. After this your
configuration files ( networking and filesystem ) will be moved onto your disks also from the installdisk.

it!. Only one more question, which is whether or not you will be running X on this server. If you plan to ever run X on this server you should chose yes, otherwise you might have to
go change machdep.allowaperture=0 into machdep.allowaperture=1 in your /etc/sysctl.conf. After this is all done, just type 'reboot' at the shell prompt and your machine will

This section will hopefully point you in the right direction for clues on what to do initially after you

<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=afterboot&sektion=8&format=html">afterboot(8)</a> man page. Which
should definitely be one of your first steps after installing OpenBSD. Here is a table which will point you to relevant

A quote from /usr/src/etc/root/root.mail
<pre>
If you wish to ensure that OpenBSD runs better on your machines, please do us
a favor (after you have your mail system setup!) and type
        dmesg | mail dmesg@openbsd.org
so that we can see what kinds of configurations people are running.  We will
use this information to improve device driver support in future releases.

Make sure you send email from an account that is able to also receive
email so developers can contact you back if they have something they want
you to test or change in order to get your setup working. It's not important
at all to send the email from the same machine that is running OpenBSD, so
if that machine is unable to receive email, just
<pre>
 dmesg | mail your-account@yourmail.dom
</pre>
and then forward that message to
<pre>
 dmesg@openbsd.org
</pre>
where <tt>your-account@yourmail.dom</tt> is your regular email account.
(or transfer the dmesg output using ftp/scp/floppydisk/carrier-pigeon/...)
</p>

<p>
<strong>NOTE</strong> - Please send only GENERIC kernel dmesgs. Custom
kernels that have device drivers removed are not helpful.

<STRONG>Question:</STRONG> - Does OpenBSD provide an ISO image available for download?
</p>

<p>
<STRONG>Answer:</STRONG> - 
No. The official OpenBSD CD-ROM layout is copyright Theo de Raadt, as an
incentive for people to buy the CD set.

Note that only the layout is copyrighted, OpenBSD itself is free.
Nothing precludes someone else to just grab OpenBSD and make their own CD.

<p>
<STRONG>Question:</strong> - I'm having problems installing with 8meg of RAM. What can i do here?
</p>

<p>
<STRONG>Answer:</STRONG> - Many people are having a problem at the end of the install where the 
system stalls on <i>MAKEDEV all ...</i>. There is a workaround for this. Basically you need to turn on swap during the install.
To do this do as described below:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Start the Install as normal
<li>Setup your disks via <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&sektion=8">fdisk(8)</a> and <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&sektion=8">disklabel(8)</a> as described above.
<li>After your disks are setup, and AFTER they've been formatted, type <i>&lt;CNTRL&gt;-C</i> to break into a shell. 
<li>type <i>reboot</i> to reboot the machine.
<li>This time, skip through the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&sektion=8">fdisk(8)</a> and <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&sektion=8">disklabel(8)</a> sections. You can do this by typing just <i>exit</i> in fdisk(8) and by typing <i>q</i> in disklabel(8).
<li>Proceed through the install until you have completed the <b>Networking Section</b> of the install. <B>NOTE:</B> This is after all packages have been installed. When you get here type <i>&lt;CNTRL&gt;-z</i>, which will put you into a shell.
<li>Here is where swap needs turned on. To do so type <i>/mnt/sbin/swapctl -a  /dev/wd0b</i> or /dev/sd0b, or whatever your swap device is.
<ul>
<li>If this isn't found, mount your root disk at <i>/mnt</i>.
</ul>
<li>Now you can type <i>fg</i> to proceed through the rest of the install.
</ul>

<p>
If you followed these instructions and still have problems mail <a href="mailto:ericj@openbsd.org">Eric Jackson &lt;ericj@openbsd.org&gt;</a>.

<h2>4.2 - What files are needed for Installation?</h2>
</p>

<p>
There are many packages containing the OpenBSD binaries, but which ones do
you need to get your system up and running? Here is an overview of each
package.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>base28.tgz</strong>    - Has the base OpenBSD system <b>Required</b></li>
    <li><strong>etc28.tgz</strong>     - Has all the files in /etc <b>Required</b></li>
    <li><strong>comp28.tz</strong>    - Has the compiler and its tools, libs. <b>Recommended</b></li>
    <li><strong>man28.tgz</strong>     - Holds man pages <b>Recommended</b></li>
    <li><strong>misc28.tgz</strong>    - Holds misc info, setup docs</li>
    <li><strong>game28.tgz</strong>    - Has the games for OpenBSD</li>
    <li><strong>xbase28.tgz</strong>   - Has the base install for X11</li>
    <li><strong>xfont28.tgz</strong>   - Holds X11's font server and fonts</li>
    <li><strong>xlink28.tgz</strong>   - Has the X servers link kit</li>
    <li><strong>xserv28.tgz</strong>   - Has X11's X servers</li>
    <li><strong>xshare28.tgz</strong>  - Has manpages, locale settings, includes, etc  for X</li>
    <li><strong>bsd</strong> 		  - This is the Kernel. <b>Required</b></li>
</ul>

<h2> 4.3 - How much space do I need for an OpenBSD installation?</h2>
</p>

<p>
The following are suggested sub-tree sizes for a full system install. 
The numbers include enough extra space to permit you to run a typical home
system that is connected to the internet.

<UL>
<LI>For a multiuser system,
you probably want to triple these values.
<LI>If you plan to install a significant amount of third party software, make your /usr partition large!  <strong>At least</strong> triple these values!
<LI>For a system that
handles lots of email or web pages (stored, respectively, in /var/mail and /var/www) you will want to make your /var partition significantly larger.
<LI>For a
multiuser system which may generate lots of logs, you will still
want to make your /var partition significantly larger (/var/log). 
</UL>
As you read this, keep in mind that /usr and /usr/X11R6 are usually
both parts of the same filesystem, that is, /usr, as there is no big
advantage to making them into separate filesystems.
<ul>
<strong>
<pre>
SYSTEM          /       /usr    /var    /usr/X11R6
alpha           56M     540M    27M     161M
amiga           45M     399M    24M      36M
hp300           31M     234M    24M      47M
i386            35M     229M    24M      72M
mac68k          29M     232M    24M      36M
mvme68k         29M     232M    24M       -  (no Xserver)
pmax            50M     355M    24M      60M
sparc           40M     259M    24M      49M
</pre>
</strong>
</ul>

<p>
When you are in the disklabel editor, you may choose to make your entire
system have just an 'a' (main filesystem) and 'b' (swap) .  The 'a' filesystem which you set up
in disklabel will become your root partition, which should be the sum of
all the 3 main values above (/, /usr, and /var) plus some space for /tmp.
The 'b' partition you set up automatically becomes your system swap
partition -- we recommend a minimum of 32MB but if you have disk to spare
make it at least 64MB.  If you have lots of disk space to spare, make this
256MB, or even 512MB.  

<P>
There are four main reasons for using separate filesystems, instead of shoving
everything into one or two filesystems:
<UL>
<LI><b>Security</b>: You can mark some filesystems as 'nosuid', 'nodev', 'noexec', 'readonly', etc..
<LI><b>Stability</b>: A user, or a misbehaved program, can fill a filesystem with garbage, if they have write permissions for it.  Your critical programs, which of course run on a different filesystem, do not get interrupted.
<LI><b>Speed</b>: A filesystem which gets written to frequently may get somewhat fragmented.  (Luckily, the ffs filesystem, what OpenBSD uses, is not prone to heavy fragmentation.)
<LI><b>Integrity</b>: If one filesystem is corrupted for some reason then your other filesystems are still OK.

<h2>4.4 - Multibooting OpenBSD (i386, alpha)</h2>
</p>

<p>
<strong>OpenBSD & NT</strong>
</p>

<p>
To multiboot OpenBSD and NT, you can use NTloader, the bootloader that NT uses. To multi-boot with NT,  you
need a copy of your OpenBSD pbr. After running installboot, you can copy it something like this:
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
	# <strong>dd if=/dev/rsd0c of=openbsd.pbr bs=512 count=1</strong>
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
Now boot NT and put openbsd.pbr in c:. Add a line like this to the end of c:\boot.ini: 
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
	c:\openbsd.pbr="OpenBSD"
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
When you reboot, you should be able to select OpenBSD from the NT loader menu. There is much more
information available about NTloader at the <a href="http://www.dorsai.org/~dcl/publications/NTLDR_Hacking/">
NTLDR Hacking Guide. </a>
</p>

<p>
<strong>OpenBSD & Windows or DOS (i386)</strong>
</p>

<p>
To boot OpenBSD along with Windows 3.1, Windows95, or DOS you must use a boot loader on the system
that can handle OpenBSD, Windows, and DOS! Some bootloaders of choice are <a href="http://www.freebird.org/sw-map/bootmanager.html">
osbs20b8.zip</a> or <a href="http://www.users.intercom.com/~ranish/part/">The Ranish Partition Manager</a>.
Both of these are able to boot OpenBSD partitions.
</p>

<p>
<strong>OpenBSD & Linux (i386)</strong>
</p>

<p>
Please refer to <a href="ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/i386/INSTALL.linux">INSTALL.linux</a>, which gives indepth instructions on getting
OpenBSD working with Linux.

<h2>4.5 - Sending your dmesg to dmesg@openbsd.org after the install</h2>
</p>

<p>
Just to remind people, it's important for the OpenBSD developers to keep track
of what hardware works, and what hardware doesn't work perfectly..
</p>

<p>
A quote from /usr/src/etc/root/root.mail
<pre>
If you wish to ensure that OpenBSD runs better on your machines, please do us
a favor (after you have your mail system setup!) and type
        dmesg | mail dmesg@openbsd.org
so that we can see what kinds of configurations people are running.  We will
use this information to improve device driver support in future releases.
(We would be much happier if this information was for the supplied GENERIC
kernel; not for a custom compiled kernel).  The device driver information
we get from this helps us fix existing drivers.
</pre>
Also check with <a href= "faq14.html#14.7">section 14.7</a>
