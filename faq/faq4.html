<h2>4.1 - Overview of the OpenBSD installation procedure</h2>
</p>

<p>
OpenBSD provides multiple ways of installing a fresh OpenBSD system for multiple architectures. This will give most everyone in almost any situation to be able to install an OpenBSD system. The seperate ways of installing an OpenBSD system are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>CD-ROM</strong> - For this you will need to have purchased and
OpenBSD CD. You can do so by going to <a href="../orders.html">http://www.openbsd.org/orders.html</a>. This is probably the easiest way of installing OpenBSD.
<li><strong>FTP</strong> - This option requires you know your IP, Netmask, Gateway, etc. If this is so, there is an enormous list of ftp mirrors around the world which make this a speedy way of getting OpenBSD on your system.
<li><strong>DHCP</strong> - This options is the same as <strong>FTP</strong> except that your IP, Netmask, Gateway and Nameservers are retrieved from the DHCP server.
<li><strong>Local Filesystem</strong> - This option allows you to install from files on a pre-existing filesystem. Support for DOS, EXT2FS and FFS are included on the install disk.
<li><strong>NFS</strong> - This allows you to install from files located on an nfs server. Read <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mount_nfs&sektion=8&format=html">mount_nfs(8)</a> for more information.
</ul>

<p>
All these methods of installation are available on ONE floppy disk. These disks can be downloaded directly from any of the ftp mirrors. ( You can get a list of mirrors on <a href="../ftp.html">http://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html</a>. )
Each architecture has their own disk, so make sure you get the correct disk for your architecture. A list of supported architectures can be found in <a href="faq1.html#1.2">FAQ 1</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here are detailed, complete walk-through guides of the installation process
for i386 and sparc architectures. Don't forget to look at the
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.6/i386/INSTALL.i386">INSTALL.i386</a>
and <A HREF="ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.6/sparc/INSTALL.sparc">INSTALL.sparc</a> documents also.

<ul>
<li><a href="install-i386.html">install-i386.html</a> for <strong>i386</strong> architecture.
<li><a href="install-sparc.html">install-sparc.html</a> for <strong>sparc</strong> architecture.
</ul>
People using other architectures are urged to look at the INSTALL.<i>arch</i>
document that comes with the OpenBSD distribution for their architecture, as well as this
<A HREF="log25.txt">generic installation walkthrough.</a>

<h3>Alpha architecture notes</h3>
<p>
Your alpha must use SRM firmware, as opposed to ARC. With the alpha architechture you can install by booting from the CD using CD2.
You can do this by using a command such as 
<ul>
<strong>boot -fi 2.6/alpha/bsd.rd dkaX</strong>
</ul>
Use <strong>show device</strong> to find your CDROM drive identifier. If you are unable to boot from the CD, you can still use the
bootdisk provided at <i>CD2:2.6/alpha/floppy26.fs</i>, and write it using the ways detailed above for the i386 architecture. And
again follow the <a href="log25.txt">install walkthrough guide</a>.
</p>

<h2>4.2 - What files are needed for Installation?</h2>
</p>

<p>
There are many packages containing the OpenBSD binaries, but which ones do
you need to get your system up and running? Here is an overview of each
package.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>base26.tar.gz</strong>    - Has the base OpenBSD system <b>Required</b></li>
    <li><strong>etc26.tar.gz</strong>     - Has all the files in /etc <b>Required</b></li>
    <li><strong>comp26.tar.gz</strong>    - Has the compiler and its tools, libs. <b>Recommended</b></li>
    <li><strong>man26.tar.gz</strong>     - Holds man pages <b>Recommended</b></li>
    <li><strong>misc26.tar.gz</strong>    - Holds misc info, setup docs</li>
    <li><strong>game26.tar.gz</strong>    - Has the games for OpenBSD</li>
    <li><strong>xbase26.tar.gz</strong>   - Has the base install for X11</li>
    <li><strong>xfont26.tar.gz</strong>   - Holds X11's font server and fonts</li>
    <li><strong>xlink26.tar.gz</strong>   - Has the X servers link kit</li>
    <li><strong>xserv26.tar.gz</strong>   - Has X11's X servers</li>
    <li><strong>xshare26.tar.gz</strong>  - Has manpages, locale settings, includes, etc  for X</li>
    <li><strong>bsd</strong> 		  - This is the Kernel. <b>Required</b></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2> 4.3 - How much space do I need for an OpenBSD installation?</h2>
</p>

<p>
The following are suggested sub-tree sizes for a full system install. 
The numbers include enough extra space to permit you to run a typical home
system that is connected to the internet.

<UL>
<LI>For a multiuser system,
you probably want to triple these values.
<LI>If you plan to install a significant amount of third party software, make your /usr parition large!  <strong>At least</strong> triple these values!
<LI>For a system that
handles lots of email or web pages (stored, respectively, in /var/mail and /var/www) you will want to make your /var partition significantly larger.
<LI>For a
multiuser system which may generate lots of logs, you will still
want to make your /var partition significantly larger (/var/log). 
</UL>
As you read this, keep in mind that /usr and /usr/X11R6 are usually
both parts of the same filesystem, that is, /usr, as there is no big
advantage to making them into separate filesystems.
<ul>
<strong>
<pre>
SYSTEM          /       /usr    /var    /usr/X11R6
alpha           56M     540M    27M     161M
amiga           45M     399M    24M      36M
arc             47M     268M    20M      60M
hp300           31M     234M    24M      47M
i386            35M     229M    24M      72M
mac68k          29M     232M    24M      36M
mvme68k         48M     448M    24M       -  (no Xserver)
pmax            50M     355M    24M      60M
sparc           40M     259M    24M      49M
powerpc		39M	423M	26M	124M
</pre>
</strong>
</ul>

<p>
When you are in the disklabel editor, you may choose to make your entire
system have just an 'a' (main filesystem) and 'b' (swap) .  The 'a' filesystem which you set up
in disklabel will become your root partition, which should be the sum of
all the 3 main values above (/, /usr, and /var) plus some space for /tmp.
The 'b' partition you set up automatically becomes your system swap
partition -- we recommend a minimum of 32MB but if you have disk to spare
make it at least 64MB.  If you have lots of disk space to spare, make this
256MB, or even 512MB.  

<P>
There are four main reasons for using separate filesystems, instead of shoving
everything into one or two filesystems:
<UL>
<LI><b>Security</b>: You can mark some filesystems as 'nosuid', 'nodev', 'noexec', 'readonly', etc..
<LI><b>Stability</b>: A user, or a misbehaved program, can fill a filesystem with garbage, if they have write permissions for it.  Your critical programs, which of course run on a different filesystem, do not get interrupted.
<LI><b>Speed</b>: A filesystem which gets written to frequently may get somewhat fragmented.  (Luckily, the ffs filesystem, what OpenBSD uses, is not prone to heavy fragmentation.)
<LI><b>Integrity</b>: If one filesystem is corrupted for some reason then your other filesystems are still OK.
</UL>

<h2>4.4 - Multibooting OpenBSD (i386, alpha)</h2>
</p>

<p>
<strong>OpenBSD & NT</strong>
</p>

<p>
To multiboot OpenBSD and NT, you can use NTloader, the bootloader that NT uses. To multi-boot with NT,  you
need a copy of your OpenBSD pbr. After running installboot, you can copy it something like this:
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
	# <strong>dd if=/dev/rsd0a of=openbsd.pbr bs=512 count=1</strong>
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
Now boot NT and put openbsd.pbr in c:. Add a line like this to the end of c:\boot.ini: 
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
	c:\openbsd.pbr="OpenBSD"
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
When you reboot, you should be able to select OpenBSD from the NT loader menu. There is much more
information available about NTloader at the <a href="http://www.dorsai.org/~dcl/publications/NTLDR_Hacking/">
NTLDR Hacking Guide. </a>
</p>

<p>
<strong>OpenBSD & Windows or DOS (i386)</strong>
</p>

<p>
To boot OpenBSD along with Windows 3.1, Windows95, or DOS you must use a boot loader on the system
that can handle OpenBSD, Windows, and DOS! Some bootloaders of choice are <a href="http://www.freebird.org/sw-map/bootmanager.html">
osbs20b8.zip</a> or <a href="http://www.users.intercom.com/~ranish/part/">The Ranish Partition Manager</a>.
Both of these are able to boot OpenBSD partitions.
</p>

<p>
<strong>OpenBSD & Linux (i386)</strong>
</p>

<p>
Please refer to <a href="INSTALL.linux">INSTALL.linux</a>, which gives indepth instructions on getting
OpenBSD working with Linux.

<h2>4.5 - Sending your dmesg to dmesg@openbsd.org after the install</h2>
</p>

<p>
Just to remind people, it's important for the OpenBSD developers to keep track
of what hardware works, and what hardware doesn't work perfectly..
</p>

<p>
A quote from /usr/src/etc/root/root.mail
<pre>
If you wish to ensure that OpenBSD runs better on your machines, please do us
a favor (after you have your mail system setup!) and type
        dmesg | mail dmesg@openbsd.org
so that we can see what kinds of configurations people are running.  We will
use this information to improve device driver support in future releases.
(We would be much happier if this information was for the supplied GENERIC
kernel; not for a custom compiled kernel).  The device driver information
we get from this helps us fix existing drivers.
</pre>
Also check with <a href= "faq14.html#14.7">section 14.7</a>
</p>
<p>
Make sure you send email from an account that is able to also receive
email so developers can contact you back if they have something they want
you to test or change in order to get your setup working. It's not important
at all to send the email from the same machine that is running OpenBSD, so
if that machine is unable to receive email, just
<pre>
 dmesg | mail your-account@yourmail.dom
</pre>
and then forward that message to
<pre>
 dmesg@openbsd.org
</pre>
where <tt>your-account@yourmail.dom</tt> is your regular email account.
(or transfer the dmesg output using ftp/scp/floppydisk/carrier-pigeon/...)
</p>

<p>
<strong>NOTE</strong> - Please send only GENERIC kernel dmesg's. Custom
kernels that have device drivers removed are not helpful.
