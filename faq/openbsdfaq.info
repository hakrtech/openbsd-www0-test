What is *OpenBSD*?
==================

   The *OpenBSD* project produces a freely available, multi-platform
4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system. Our efforts place emphasis on
portability, standardization, correctness, and security.  *OpenBSD*
supports binary emulation of most binaries from SVR4 (Solaris),
FreeBSD, Linux, BSDI, SunOS, and HPUX.

   More about the project goals: goals.html, goals.html.


File: openbsdfaq.info,  Node: Free,  Next: Why,  Prev: About,  Up: Introduction

Is it really free?
==================

   *OpenBSD* is all free.  The binaries are free.  The source is free.
All parts of *OpenBSD* have reasonable copyright terms permitting free
redistribution.

   More about copyright policy:  policy.html, policy.html.

   The maintainers of *OpenBSD* support the project largely from their
own pockets.  This includes the time spent programming for the project,
equipment used to support the many ports, the network resources used to
distribute *OpenBSD* to you, and the time spent answering questions and
investigating users' bug reports. The *OpenBSD* developers are not
independently wealthy and even small contributions of time, equipment,
and resources make a big difference.

Why might I want to use *OpenBSD*?
==================================

   New users frequently want to know whether *OpenBSD* is superior to
some other free UNIX-like operating system.  That question is largely
un-answerable and is the subject of countless (and useless) religious
debates.  *Do not, under any circumstances, ask such a question on an
OpenBSD mailing list.*

   Below are some reasons why we think *OpenBSD* is a useful operating
system.  Whether *OpenBSD* is right for you is a question that only you
can answer.

   * *OpenBSD* runs on many different hardware platforms.

   * *OpenBSD* developers have spent countless hours in a focused
     effort to systematically eliminate security holes (and potential
     security holes) from the code.

   * *OpenBSD* is a full-featured UNIX-like operating system available
     in source form at no charge.

   * *OpenBSD* integrates cutting-edge security technology suitable for
     building firewalls and private network services in a distributed
     environment.

   * *OpenBSD* benefits from strong on-going development in many areas,
     offering opportunities to work with emerging technologies with an
     international community of programmers and end-users.

   * *OpenBSD* offers opportunities for ordinary people to participate
     in the development and testing of the product.

What platforms are supported?
=============================

   Information about supported hardware platforms and peripherals can
be found on the platforms web page: plat.html, plat.html.

   More specific information is sometimes available from the port
maintainers.  Read the platforms web page first.

   Support for specific platforms and peripherals often changes rapidly.
If your equipment is not supported in the latest full release, you may
find success in the current source or snapshot for your platform.

How can I help support *OpenBSD*?
=================================

   We are greatly indebted to the people and organizations that have
contributed to the *OpenBSD* project.  They are acknowledged by name
here: donations.html, donations.html.

   *OpenBSD* has a constant need for several types of support from the
user community.  If you find *OpenBSD* useful, you are strongly
encouraged to find a way to contribute.  If none of the suggestions
below are right for you, feel free to propose an alternative by sending
e-mail to donations@openbsd.org.

   * Buy an *OpenBSD* CD.  Includes the current full release of
     *OpenBSD*, and is bootable on many platforms.   Generates revenue
     to support the *OpenBSD* project, and reduces the strain on
     network resources used to deliver the distribution via the
     Internet.  This inexpensive two-CD set includes full source.
     Remember, your friends need their own copy!

   * Donate money.  The project has a constant need for cash to pay for
     equipment, network connectivity, and expenses relating to CD
     publishing.  Manufacturing CDs requires an up-front out-of-pocket
     investment for the *OpenBSD* developers, without guaranteed
     return.  Send e-mail to donations@openbsd.org to find out how to
     contribute.  Even small donations make a profound difference.

   * Donate equipment and parts.  The project has a constant need for
     general and specific hardware.  Items such as IDE and SCSI disks,
     and various types of RAM are always welcome.  For other types of
     hardware such as computer systems and motherboards, you should
     inquire as to current need.  Write to donations@openbsd.org to
     arrange for shipment.

   * Donate your time and skills.  Programmers who enjoy writing
     operating systems are naturally always welcome, but there are
     literally dozens of other ways that people can be useful.  Follow
     mailing lists and help answer new-user questions.  Help maintain
     documentation by submitting new FAQ material (to faq@openbsd.org).
     Form a local user group and get your friends hooked on *OpenBSD*.
     Make a case to your employer for using *OpenBSD* at work.  If
     you're a student, talk to your professors about using *OpenBSD* as
     a learning tool for Computer Science or Engineering courses.

   It's also worth mentioning one of the most important ways you
*should not* try to "help" the *OpenBSD* project: do not waste your
time engaging in operating system flame wars on Usenet newsgroups.  It
does nothing to help the project find new users, and it can cause
substantial harm to important relationships that *OpenBSD* developers
have with other operating system developers.  The *OpenBSD* team uses,
learns from, and respects many different operating systems and does not
presume to dictate what others should use.

Who maintains *OpenBSD*?
========================

   *OpenBSD* is maintained by a development team spread across many
different countries.  The project is coordinated by Theo de Raadt,
located in Canada.

Web pages.
==========

   The official *OpenBSD* web site is: http://www.openbsd.org/,
http://www.openbsd.org/.

   The web site is a good place to find basic information about
*OpenBSD*, current releases and supported hardware, archived mailing
lists, the bug tracking system, and information about obtaining source
and binary distributions of *OpenBSD*.

Mailing lists.
==============

   The *OpenBSD* project maintains several popular mailing lists which
users should subscribe to and follow.  To subscribe to a mailing list,
send an e-mail message to majordomo@openbsd.org.  That address is an
automated subscription service.  In the body of your message, on a
single line, you should include a `subscribe' command for the list you
wish to join.  For example:

     subscribe announce

   The list processor will reply to you, asking for confirmation of your
intent to join the list.  The confirmation you send back to the list
processor will be included in its reply to you.  It will look something
like this:

     auth 90855167 subscribe announce you

   Once you have confirmed your intent to join, you will be immediately
added to the list, and the list processor will notify you that you were
successfully added.

   To unsubscribe from a list, you will again send an e-mail message to
majordomo@openbsd.org.  It might look like this:

     unsubscribe announce

   If you have any difficulties with the mailing list system, please
first read the instructions.  They can be obtained by sending an e-mail
message to majordomo@openbsd.org with a message body of `help'.

   These are the currently-available *OpenBSD* mailing lists:

   .3 .7  announce		 Important announcements.  This is a low-volume list.
tech		 General technical discussions.   misc		 User questions and
answers.   bugs		 Bugs received via `sendbug(1)' and discussions
about them.   source-changes	 Automated mailing of CVS source
tree changes.   ports		 Discussions about the use of the FreeBSD 'ports'
source tree.   multitable
