    <h2>
      Upgrading from 3.2
    </h2>

    <a name="3.2.1"></a>
    <h3>
      3.2.1: New Perl (2002/11/05)
    </h3>

    <p>Perl has been updated to version 5.8.0.<br>
      In Perl 5.8.0, the XS module API has changed due to a switch
      from stdio to PerlIO (see the perldelta manual page for more information).
      This means that any XS modules (perl .so files) you have installed
      <strong>must</strong> be rebuilt.  If you encounter an error such as
      <em>Undefined symbol "perl_get_sv"</em> this is your problem.  If the
      only modules you have installed were installed as packages or via the
      ports system, you can check your system for XS modules by running:
      <pre>
	# grep '\.so' /var/db/pkg/p5-*/+CONTENTS | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u
      </pre>
      You can then remove the offending modules with <em>pkg_delete -f</em>
      and rebuild/install them from the ports tree.

    <a name="3.2.2"></a>
    <h3>
      3.2.2: New groups _radius, _token and _shadow (2002/11/21)
    </h3>
    <p>Several new groups have been added:
      <ul>
      <li>The <em>_radius</em> group controls read-only access to
	  <tt>/etc/raddb/servers</tt> file.
      <li>The <em>_token</em> group controls read-only access to the
	  token databases used by 
	  <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tokeninit&amp;sektion=8">tokeninit(8)</a>,
	  <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tokenadm&amp;sektion=8">tokenadm(8)</a>, and
	  <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=login_token&amp;sektion=8">login_token(8)</a>.
      <li>The <em>_shadow</em> group controls read-only access to
	  the shadow password database.
      </ul>

      You will need to add these groups and adjust the permissions on
      some files before running a &quot;make build&quot;.  The following
      commands, run as root, will do this:
	<pre>
	  # groupadd -g 63 _radius
	  # chgrp _radius /etc/raddb /etc/raddb/servers
	  # chmod g+x /etc/raddb
	  # chmod g+r /etc/raddb/servers

	  # groupadd -g 64 _token
	  # chgrp _token /etc/activ.db /etc/crypto.db /etc/snk.db
	  # chmod 0640 /etc/activ.db /etc/crypto.db /etc/snk.db

	  # groupadd -g 65 _shadow
	  # chgrp _shadow /etc/spwd.db
	  # chmod 0640 /etc/spwd.db
	</pre>

      Don't worry about error messages indicating that a file was not found.
      That just means you haven't setup <em>token</em> or <em>radius</em> authentication.

    <h3>
      3.2.3: Important compiler changes (2002/12/02)
    </h3>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.trl.ibm.com/projects/security/ssp">propolice</a>
      stack protection extension has been merged into
      <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=gcc-local&amp;sektion=1"
      >gcc</a>. This requires a slightly different upgrade scenario:
      <ul>
      <li>Do <b>not</b> build a new kernel yet.
      <li>Do <b>not</b> rebuild gcc yet.
      <li>Build and install a new ld.so dynamic loader if your system has
        shared libraries.
        <pre>
	  # cd /usr/src
	  # make obj
          For ELF platforms (alpha, macppc, sparc, sparc64):
          # cd /usr/src/libexec/ld.so
          # make depend &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
	  For a.out platforms (amiga, hp300, i386, mac68k, mvme68k):
          # cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/ld/rtld
          # make depend &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
	</pre>
      <li>Rebuild and install a new libc, following the first few commands
        from <i>make build</i>.
	<pre>
          # cd /usr/src/include
	  # make prereq &amp;&amp; make includes
	  # cd /usr/src/lib/libc
	  # make depend &amp;&amp; make NOMAN=1 &amp;&amp; make NOMAN=1 install
	</pre>
	Note that, if your compiler is too old, it will not be able to build
	libc. In this case, you'll have to do a binary upgrade from a snapshot.
      <li>Rebuild and install gcc, as told in section <a href="#1.8">1.8</a>.
      <li>You can now recompile a kernel.
        Be sure to run
        <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=config&amp;sektion=8"
	>config</a> again to regenerate the kernel Makefile.
      <li>Reboot on the new kernel, and run a <i>make build</i> to
        benefit from the stack protection.
      </ul>

    <a name="3.2.4"></a>
    <h3>
      3.2.4: New user and group _spamd (2002/12/24)
    </h3>
    <p>A new user and a new group _spamd for the
      <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=spamd&amp;sektion=8"
      >spamd(8)</a> daemon have been added.
      Add the group by running
<pre>
  # groupadd -g 62 _spamd
</pre>
      as root, and add the user entry using
      <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=vipw&amp;sektion=8">vipw(8)</a>:
<pre>
  _spamd:*:62:62::0:0:Spam daemon:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin
</pre>

    <a name="3.2.5"></a>
    <h3>
      3.2.5: Alias for ipv6-icmp (2002/12/30)
    </h3>

    <p>A new alias for ipv6-icmp, <em>icmp6</em> , has been added to
      <tt>/etc/protocols</tt>.  If you wish to use the <em>icmp6</em> alias
      (used in the
      <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pfctl&amp;sektion=8">pfctl(8)</a>
      regression tests) you must modify the <em>ipv6-icmp</em> line in
      <tt>/etc/protocols</tt>, adding the <em>icmp6</em> keyword before the #.
      The line should read as follows:
    </p>
<pre>
  ipv6-icmp 58    IPv6-ICMP icmp6 # ICMP for IPv6
</pre>

    <a name="3.2.6"></a>
    <h3>
      3.2.6: New group _lkm (2003/01/05)
    </h3>

    <p>The <em>_lkm</em> group controls access to
	  <tt>/dev/lkm</tt>.
	  <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=modstat&amp;sektion=8">modstat(8)</a>
          is now setgid _lkm.
    <p>
      You will need to add this group and adjust the permissions on
      <tt>/dev/lkm</tt> before running a &quot;make build&quot;.  The following
      commands, run as root, will do this:
<pre>
  # groupadd -g 61 _lkm
  # chgrp _lkm /dev/lkm
</pre>

    <a name="3.2.7"></a>
    <h3>
      3.2.7: New libpthread (2003/01/14)
    </h3>

    <p><em>libc_r</em> and <em>libnpthread</em> have been removed and
    replaced by <em>libpthread</em>.  Threaded programs should still
    be compiled using the <em>-pthread</em> option; the compiler does
    the right thing.

    <p>Before removing <em>libc_r</em> and <em>libnpthread</em> threaded
    applications must be re-compiled using <em>libpthread</em>.  The
    recommended build sequence is:

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>build gcc according to section <a href="#1.8">1.8</a>.
      <li>
        <p>re-build the system according to section <a href="#1.5">1.5</a>.
      <li>
        <p>re-build all threaded ports.
      <li>
        <p>remove the now unused libraries:
<pre>
  # rm /usr/lib/libc_r* /usr/lib/libnpthread*
</pre>
    </ol>

    <a name="3.2.8"></a>
    <h3>
      3.2.8: Linker changes for ELF architectures (2003/01/17)
    </h3>

    <p>Binutils/ld have been changed to introduce a new security feature to ELF
    executables. Instead of allowing the data section of executables and
    shared libraries to be marked executable by the linker, the layout has
    been changed to only mark the appropriate sections of the program image
    as executable. This change only affects ELF based architectures: alpha,
    sparc, sparc64, macppc.
    <p>
    It is recommended that binutils be rebuilt before the rest of the system.
    <p>
<pre>
  # cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/binutils
  # make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper cleandir
  # make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper obj
  # make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper depend
  # make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper
  # make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install
</pre>
    <p>
    Then re-build the system according to section <a href="#1.5">1.5</a>

    <a name="3.2.9"></a>
    <h3>
      3.2.9: Removal of /var/at and crontab changes (2003/02/19)
    </h3>

    <p>The contents of <tt>/var/at</tt> have been merged into <tt>/var/cron</tt>
    now that <em>at</em> has been integrated into <em>cron</em>.  Furthermore,
    the <em>cron</em> allow and deny files have been renamed cron.allow and
    cron.deny for POSIX compliance and consistency with at.allow and at.deny.
    <p>
    First re-build the system according to section <a href="#1.5">1.5</a>
    Then move the existing files and restart cron as follows:
    <p>
<pre>
  # mv /var/at/* /var/cron
  # mv /var/cron/jobs /var/cron/atjobs
  # mv /var/cron/allow /var/cron/cron.allow
  # mv /var/cron/deny /var/cron/cron.deny
  # rm -rf /var/at 
  # kill `cat /var/run/cron.pid`
  # /usr/sbin/cron
</pre>
    <p>
    Disregard any warnings about missing allow or deny files.
    Not all of them are part of the default installation.
    <p>
    If you do not already have a cron.deny file (it was not installed
    prior to OpenBSD 3.3) you will need one to run <em>crontab</em> as
    a user other than the superuser.
<pre>
  # install -c -o root -g crontab -m 660 /dev/null /var/cron/cron.deny
</pre>

    <h3>
      3.1.1: New users/groups
    </h3>

    <p>Several new users/groups have been added. 
      In support of 
      <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=authpf&amp;sektion=8"
      >authpf(8)</a>, a new group is required. Also, to support
      <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;sektion=8">sshd(8)</a>'s
      privilege separation feature, a new user and group named <em>sshd</em>
      have been added to the system.
      More new users for system services have been added, they are prefixed
      with &quot;_&quot;.
      Add the following user entries using

      <em>crontab</em>.

    <p>
      Before you run &quot;make build&quot;, you will need to add the
      <em>crontab</em> group.
      Add a line like the following to your <tt>/etc/group</tt> file:</p>

<pre>
  crontab:*:66:
</pre>

<p>
      The &quot;make build&quot; will update some, but not all, permissions
      for you.  After &quot;make build&quot; finishes, you must run following
      by hand (assumes <tt>/bin/csh</tt>):
</p>

<pre>
  # chgrp crontab /var/at/at.{allow,deny} /var/cron/{allow,deny}
  # chmod 0640 /var/at/at.{allow,deny} /var/cron/{allow,deny}

      Note that you probably will not have all of the allow/deny files;
      this is not a problem.

    <h3>2.9.1: New users/groups - <em>proxy</em>, <em>smmsp</em>, and
      <em>popa3d</em>.</h3>

    <p>
      First, with the addition of the 
      <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf&amp;sektion=4">
	pf(4)</a> firewalling package, and its 
      <a href=
	 "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftp-proxy&amp;sektion=8"
	 >ftp-proxy(8)</a> suite, a new user and group named
      <em>proxy</em> were added to the system. To support this
      addition, add the following user entry using 
      <a href=
	 "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=vipw&amp;sektion=8">
	vipw(8)</a>:</p>
    
<pre>
proxy:*:71:71::0:0:Proxy Services:/nonexistent:/sbin/nologin
</pre>

    <p>Also add the <em>proxy</em> group to /etc/group:</p>

<pre>
proxy:*:71:
</pre>

    <p>Second, as part of the Sendmail 8.12 upgrade, sendmail no
      longer runs setuid root. Both a new user and a new group, named
      <em>smmsp</em>, have been added to the system. Add a line like
      the following to your <tt>/etc/group</tt>:</p>

<pre>
smmsp:*:25:
</pre>

    <p>Then, run 
      <a href=
	 "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=vipw&amp;sektion=8">
	vipw(8)</a> and add the following line for the <em>smmsp</em>
      user:</p>

<pre>
smmsp:*:25:25::0:0:Sendmail Message Submission Program:/nonexistent:/sbin/nologin
</pre>

    <p>Make sure this line appears before any <a href=
      "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=yp&amp;sektion=8">
      yp(8)</a> settings line.</p>

    <p>Finally, a new user and group were added for Solar
      Designer's popa3d server, now part of the core system. Add the
      following to <tt>/etc/group</tt>:</p>

<pre>
popa3d:*:26:
</pre>

    <p>And using <a href=
      "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=vipw&amp;sektion=8">
      vipw(8)</a>, add</p>
<pre>
popa3d:*:26:26::0:0:POP3 server:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin
</pre>

    <a name="2.9.2"></a> 
    <h3>2.9.2: New packet filter: <em>pf</em></h3>

    <p>The IPF firewalling package that has been part of previous
      OpenBSD releases has been replaced with an all-new firewalling
      suite called <a href=
      "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf&amp;sektion=4">
	pf(4)</a>. As a result, a number of changes need to be
      made.</p>

    <p>First, <em>pf</em> depends on a new device file. To ensure
      that this special device is created, do the following:</p>

<pre>
  # cd /dev
  # cp /usr/src/etc/etc.`machine`/MAKEDEV ./
  # ./MAKEDEV all
</pre>

    <p>Second, a number of filesystem change have occurred. For
      your reference, the following binaries have been replaced:</p>

<pre>
OLD:
/sbin/ipf /sbin/ipfstat /sbin/ipnat /usr/sbin/ipfs
/usr/sbin/ipftest /usr/sbin/ipmon /usr/sbin/ipresend
/usr/sbin/ipsend /usr/sbin/iptest
NEW:
/sbin/pfctl
/usr/libexec/ftp-proxy
</pre>

    <p>Similarly, for the devices:</p>

<pre>
OLD: /dev/ipl /dev/ipnat /dev/ipstate /dev/ipauth
NEW: /dev/pf
</pre>

    <p>And finally, the filter configuration files:</p>

<pre>
OLD: /etc/ipf.rules /etc/ipnat.rules
NEW: /etc/pf.conf /etc/nat.conf
</pre>
    <p>The old ipfilter sample configuration files may be removed:
    </p>
<pre>
  # rm -rf /usr/share/ipf
</pre>

    <p>A mechanism for safely enabling <em>pf</em> has been added
      to the <tt>/etc/rc</tt> and <tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt> files. You
      will need to update these files to include the new hooking
      mechanism. If you wish to enable <em>pf</em>, set PF=YES in
      <tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt>.</p>

    <a name="2.9.3"></a> 
    <h3>2.9.3: Changes to <em>make</em></h3>

    <p>There have been changes to <a href=
      "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=make&amp;sektion=1">
	make(1)</a> and its data files which may cause difficulties in
      the build process. This usually manifests as errors from
      <em>bsd.own.mk</em> during the build. To avoid these issues,
      first update the data files:</p>
<pre>
  # cd /usr/src/share/mk
  # make install
</pre>

    <p>Then build and install the new make.</p>

<pre>
  # cd /usr/src/usr.bin/make
  # make clean &amp;&amp; make obj &amp;&amp; make depend &amp;&amp; make
  # make install
</pre>

    <p>Now proceed with your upgrade.</p>
    
    <a name="2.9.4"></a>
    <h3>2.9.4: Build fails because of KerberosV errors</h3>

    <p>Before you try building the whole system, you need to first
      build KerberosV.</p>

    <p>First, there is a new KerberosV configuration directory in
      <em>/etc</em>. If you have not already done so, use the <a href=
      "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mtree&amp;sektion=8">
	mtree(8)</a> procedure described in <a href="#1.13">section
	1.13</a> to create it:</p>

    <p>Now, build KerberosV</p>

<pre>
  # cd /usr/src/kerberosV
  # make obj
  # cd lib/roken
  # make 
  # cd ../../usr.bin/asn1_compile
  # make
  # make install
</pre>

    <p>You may also need to update your <tt>/etc/login.conf</tt>,
      to reflect that the file
      <tt>/usr/libexec/auth/login_krb-or-pwd</tt> has been renamed to
      <tt>login_krb<strong>4</strong>-or-pwd</tt>.</p>

    <a name="2.9.5"></a> 
    <h3>2.9.5: New <em>sendmail</em> version</h3>

    <p><a href=
      "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sendmail&amp;sektion=8">
	sendmail(8)</a> has been upgraded to version 8.12. As this
      version of <em>sendmail</em> no longer runs setuid root,
      significant changes have resulted.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Both a new user and a new group (<em>smmsp</em>) have
	been added. If you have not yet done so, follow the procedure
	in <a href="#2.9.1">section 2.9.1</a> to create them.</li>

      <li>Several changes to the file hierarchy have occurred,
	including a new <tt>/var/spool/clientmqueue</tt> directory
	and new permissions for <tt>/var/spool/mqueue</tt>. These
	changes can both be made using the <a href=
        "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mtree&amp;sektion=8">
	  mtree(8)</a> procedure described in <a href="#1.13">section
	  1.13</a>.</li>

      <li>
        <p>Add the following to root's <a href=
          "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=crontab&amp;sektion=1">
	    crontab(1)</a>. This is necessary since <em>sendmail</em>
	  is no longer setuid root, and relies on this entry to do
	  parts of its job:</p>

<pre>
# sendmail clientmqueue runner
*/30    *       *       *       *       /usr/sbin/sendmail -L sm-msp-queue -Ac -q
</pre>

      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p>Upgrade sendmail:</p>

<pre>
  # cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.sbin/sendmail
  # make clean &amp;&amp; make obj &amp;&amp; make depend &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The files <tt>submit.cf</tt> and
	  <tt>localhost.cf</tt> have been installed to your
	  <tt>/etc/mail</tt> directory. The first of these,
	  <tt>submit.cf</tt> (referred to as the "client"
	  configuration file in current sendmail documentation) is
	  used by mail user agents that want to submit mail locally
	  for delivery via sendmail. Due to the permissions changes
	  described above, this does not require root privileges; the
	  sendmail binary is set-groupid to group smmsp. The second
	  file, <tt>localhost.cf</tt>, is an OpenBSD-ism that runs
	  sendmail only listening on the localhost interface to
	  accept mail from the local host but not accept connections
	  from the network (you almost certainly want this if you
	  also use e.g., <a href=
          "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=smtpd&amp;sektion=8">
	    smtpd(8)</a> listening on the SMTP port on your outside
	  interface). For more details, see the file
	  <tt>SECURITY</tt> in
	  <tt>/usr/src/gnu/usr.sbin/sendmail/sendmail</tt>.</p>

        <p>It is highly recommended that you regenerate and update
	  your sendmail configuration files in <tt>/etc/mail</tt>.
	  You can find some working configuration files in
	  <tt>/usr/share/sendmail/cf</tt>. Note that localhost.cf is
	  generated from openbsd-localhost.mc.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>If you were running sendmail without the <tt>-bd</tt>
	  option in <tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt>, as the default
	  installation settings do, you will need to use
	  <tt>localhost.cf</tt>. Edit <tt>rc.conf</tt> to use the
	  following:</p>
<pre>
# For normal use: "-L sm-mta -bd -q30m"
sendmail_flags="-L sm-mta -C/etc/mail/localhost.cf -bd -q30m"
</pre>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Once your configuration file is ready, <a href=
         "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=kill&amp;sektion=1">
	    kill(1)</a> the existing sendmail:</p>
<pre>
  kill `sed 1q /var/run/sendmail.pid`
</pre>

        <p>Restart the new sendmail with the appropriate options,
	  for example:</p>
<pre>
  /usr/sbin/sendmail -L sm-mta -bd -q30m
</pre>

        <p>for a configuration accepting mail from outside, or</p>

<pre>
  /usr/sbin/sendmail -L sm-mta -C/etc/mail/localhost.cf -bd -q30m
</pre>

        <p>for a local mail-only configuration.</p>
	
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> the <tt>-bd</tt> flag is now
	  needed in both cases.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The new <em>sendmail</em> should now be running.</p>

should follow exactly this procedure:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <a href="upgrade-minifaq.html#1.10">Clean the cruft</a> from your source tree, and fetch

<p>
These four drivers were replaced with a unified <em>dc</em> driver.
You must change all occurrences of <em>pn*</em>, <em>mx</em>,

2.6.3: Upgrading gcc 2.95.1 to 2.95.2
</h3>

<p><em>gcc</em> 2.95.2 was merged into the OpenBSD source tree around
January 19, 2000. In order for <em>gcc</em> to build properly, a more
recent (post 2.6) <em>libiberty</em> is required. To build this library,
do the following:</p>

<pre>
	cd /usr/src/gnu/egcs/libiberty
	make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean
	make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper obj
	make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper
	make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install
</pre>

<p>
NOTE: On mips-based architectures, such as pmax, you must
perform an explicit <em>ldconfig</em> after new libraries are build.
</p>

<p>Once <em>libiberty</em> is build, you may proceed with a standard
<em>gcc</em> bootstrap:</p>

<pre>
   cd /usr/src/gnu/egcs/gcc
   make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean

<h3>
2.6.6: Upgrading Sendmail.
</h3>

<p>
In sendmail 8.10.X, locations (and names) of the sendmail configuration files
have changed.  Everything but the pid file now lives in /etc/mail.
Additionally, several files have changed names.
</p>

<table border="0">
<tr>
  <td><strong>OLD</strong></td>
  <td><strong>NEW</strong></td>

</table>

<p>
There are a couple of ways to convert from the old sendmail config
to the new, but the first step is always the same.
</p>

<ol>
<li> Update <tt>/etc/rc</tt> so that it looks for
     <tt>/etc/mail/sendmail.cf</tt> instead of <tt>/etc/sendmail.cf</tt>
</li>
<li> <tt>mv /etc/sendmail.cf /etc/mail/sendmail.cf</tt> <br />
     This is the path of least resistance and you won't have to change
     the location of any other files.
</li>
<li> Or, build a new .cf file from your .mc source file.  Note that you
     no longer need to specify the line:
     <pre>include(`../m4/cf.m4')</pre>
     since it will be included for you by make.  Also note that when
     adding machines to class w (via "Cw machinename"), you now need
     to do that in the LOCAL_CONFIG section (see <tt>openbsd-lists.mc</tt>
     for an example).

<h3>
2.5.1: What are the major problems upgrading from 2.5 to 2.6?
</h3>

<h5><em>perl</em> and <em>make</em></h5>
<p>
The latest version of Perl (5.005_03) requires a new version of
<em>make</em> to compile properly. You must rebuild make before
building the new Perl. Do a:
</p>

<pre>
# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/make
# make clean &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<p>
Then go ahead and rebuild the new Perl. You will need to clean out the Perl
<code>obj</code> directory by hand before building.
</p>

<p>
Perl developers should take note of the latest changes. From 
millert@openbsd.org:
</p>

<pre>
The version of perl in the OpenBSD source tree (post 2.5) has been
upgraded to 5.005_03.  The build method has changed somewhat but
most of that should be invisible.  The important changes that affect
people are as follows:

1) Perl lib files have moved from /usr/lib/perl5 to the more correct
/usr/libdata/perl5
2) The default site_perl directories now live in /usr/local.  Ie:
if you install a perl module, it will place itself in
/usr/local/libdata/perl5/site_lib.  This makes it easy to
see what non-stock modules you have.  It also means that we
can have perl modules in the ports system easily.
3) The perl library man pages are now install in /usr/share/man/cat3p
You'll need to update your man.conf based on the src/etc/man.conf
to take advantage of them.  This means you can now do
"man 3p less" and get info on the less pragma but "man less"
will still get you the less pager manpage.

If you have modules or other non-stock perl files the simplest thing
to do is to move /usr/lib/perl5 to /usr/libdata/perl5 and add a link
from /usr/lib/perl5 to /usr/libdata/perl5.  Alternately, you could
just edit the installed Config.pm file and fix up the paths there.

<h3>
2.5.2: How do I upgrade <em>gcc</em> to <em>egcs</em>
</h3>

<p>
The safest way will be to upgrade to a recent snapshot, once one is 
available. <strong>Look for a snapshot first!</strong>. Bootstrapping the new 
compiler from the old should be a <em>last resort</em>.
</p>

<p>
First, note that some platforms have not been bootstrapped
successfully yet. To date, the following should work, if you are 
careful:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>i386</strong>
<li><strong>sparc</strong>
<li><strong>m68k</strong>
<li><strong>alpha</strong>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>mips</strong> and <strong>rs6000</strong> have problems.
</p>

<p>
To test whether your platform can be bootstrapped, grab and install
the egcs-snapshot, available from the 
<a href="../ports.html">ports collection</a>. 
If this works, the in-tree version likely will, too.
This is the <em>safest</em> method of proceeding.
</p>

<p>
Now, before going any further, ensure that your copies of
<em>binutils</em>, <em>gas</em>, and <em>ld</em> are up to date.  Note
that there are two copies of <em>gas</em> and <em>ld</em> in the tree.
On <strong>i386</strong> and <strong>sparc</strong>, the binutils
versions are not used.  Check <tt>/usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/gas</tt> and
<tt>/usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/ld</tt> instead.
</p>

<p>
The following instructions referred to the original egcs snapshot 
(egcs-990517). Since that time, a second snapshot (egcs-990608) has gone
into the tree. If you are coming from vanilla 2.5, it is unlikely that
you will be able to build the latest version directly. In this event, you
will have to bootstrap an intermediate version using these instructions.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Today, the compiler changes.

Exit gcc 2.8.1, enter egcs... or more precisely, gcc 2.95 prerelease.

This is probably going to be a rough ride, but I can't work out all
the kinks on every architecture by myself.

I'm going to start importing stuff *now*. There will be a second message
to tech@ once things are settled...

Thanks to everyone who helped me sorting stuff out, most especially
niklas, turan, and millert.

Why the switch
--------------
as most of you already know, egcs is now the *official* compiler supported
by the FSF.  The upcoming july release as been re-christened gcc 2.95.

Just looking at the log messages will show you many improvements:
support for newer processors is better, C++ is more accurately matching
the ANSI/ISO standards, Fortran 77 is more closely integrated.
There are also countless bug-fixes and code generation improvements.

Also the development is more open. There is a cvs tree, there are several
mailing-lists available, and we are cooperating closely with the egcs
team. More precisely, I've been feeding patches back to the egcs team
so that OpenBSD configurations are officially supported.
Also, the development team is highly responsive to bug-reports, and problems
get fixed.

There also is a band-wagon phenomenon: everyone is switching to egcs,
which means lots of code to test the compiler on, and that we can benefit
from related projects.

Why now
-------
egcs-1.1 was unfit for some purposes. Specifically, code size on i386
was larger than gcc 2.8.1, which yielded floppy-disks problems. 
At 2.5 freeze, the only code fit to include was a somewhat unstable
snapshot.  In the interest of stability, after much pondering, egcs was
not put into 2.5.

Right now, the egcs project is going through a release cycle which will
yield egcs 1.2.  Judging from their time schedule, there is ample margin
between egcs 1.2 and the next release of OpenBSD.  Also, we want to get
in now, so that we get a chance to report problems on less frequently 
used architectures, and get everything fixed for 1.2.

egcs `feature freeze' is supposed to occur on may 7th, and the current
snapshot 19990502 looks solid.

What works and what doesn't
---------------------------
egcs runs an i386 OpenBSD system without problems.  m68k works as well,
with a few work-arounds linked to obscure bugs that will get fixed.
sparc seems to be running as well.  There is some linker trouble on some 
other arches that needs to be fixed before our next release.

Right now, constructors across dynamic libraries are not quite ready.

egcs now features a stand-alone cpp which is going to be better than
the current hackish solution we use. This means a few interface changes
and possibly weird warnings.

Keeping gcc 2.8.1 ?
-------------------
due to size constraints, as soon as egcs is imported, gcc is going
to move to cvs Attic.  If you don't want to deal with egcs now, you'll
have to be careful through your cvs updates.
Some Makefiles are bound to change: includes, gnu/usr.bin, and gnu/lib.
xlint and cpp.sh are going to change as well.

How to bootstrap the compiler
-----------------------------
the simplest way is probably to trust the various arch maintainers
and download a snapshot.

If you want to do stuff the hard way, you must first remake proper
obj dirs:
cd /usr/src
make obj

If you run i386, gas must be up-to-date.
If you run sparc, ld must be up-to-date.

then build libiberty:
cd /usr/src/gnu/egcs/libiberty
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper depend
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper 
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install

then the C compiler:
cd /usr/src/gnu/egcs/gcc
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper depend
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper 
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install

rebuild the C compiler with the new version:
cd /usr/src/gnu/egcs/gcc
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper depend
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper 
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install

rebuild the includes
cd /usr/src/include
make includes

build all egcs libraries and install them
cd /usr/src/gnu/egcs
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper depend
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper 
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install

install the new cpp driver
cd /usr/src/usr.bin/cpp
make install

then you're all set, and a standard make build should work...
</pre>


<p>
[author note: Actually, it doesn't quite work. xlint will fail to build.
The fix is simple though. Simply do a 
<code> make &amp;&amp; make install </code>
in the <code>/usr/src/usr.bin/xlint/xlint</code> directory before 
you attempt a <em>make build</em> and proceed. See <a href="#2.5.2.2">2.5.2.2</a>.]
</p>

<pre>
If it doesn't, you're using an arch that didn't go through make build yet.
The most probably occurrence is an Internal Compiler Error, as known as an
ICE.

First try to see if the ICE will go away with -O1 or -O0. In that case, you
can put a work-around in the Makefile until it's fixed 
(see /usr/src/lib/libm/Makefile for an example of how to put in such
work-arounds for m68k).

Then the error needs to be reported to the egcs-bugs mailing list.

At a minimum, you must run the source through the same compiler invocation,
with an addition of -v -save-temps to the options.

-v yields the precise sequence of commands invoked by gcc. -save-temps
will give you a pre-processed C file (.i) or C++ (.ii) that the egcs people
can make sense of... you can't ask them to run OpenBSD on their boxes.

If you have more time, you can try to trim down the pre-processed C file to
the bare minimum that triggers the bug. Dichotomy works nicely.

2.5.2.3 - Core Dump on <tt>uthread_autoinit.c</tt>
</h5>

<p>
You have fallen victim to a linker bug. Here's a relevant message:
</p>

<pre>
From: Marc Espie &lt;Marc.Espie@liafa.jussieu.fr&gt;
Subject: egcs core-dumping on uthread_autoinit.c

If this happens to you, this is a known linker problem... the cc1 you have
was linked in a weird way.

Initially, I made cc1 link against static /usr/lib/libiberty.a to avoid this
problem, but this was cutting things too close, and the bug reappeared,
probably thanks to unrelated changes in libc or elsewhere...

The tree has been patched with a work-around in

src/gnu/egcs/f/lang-options.h

make sure you have the kludged version of that file (at least rev 1.2),
recompile and reinstall cc1, the problem should go away.

What's going on is that the 386 linker gets something wrong because of
the huge strings array in toplev.c, and something gets mislinked, so
that
void f(void) __attribute((constructor)) {}
kills cc1.

As a work-around, I've killed Fortran options help texts, until someone finds
where the linker errs.

<h5>
2.5.2.4 - <em>egcs</em> seems much slower than <em>gcc</em>
</h5>

<p>
It is, but there is a reason. <em>egcs</em> performs more optimizing passes.
Data alignment and other such functionality will be better with 
<em>egcs</em>-generated code.
</p>

<a name="2.5.2.5"></a>
<h5>
2.5.2.5 - <em>egcs</em> generates larger code than <em>gcc</em>
</h5>

<p>
Yes it does. This is especially noticeable with the old <tt>-O2</tt>
gcc switch.  <em>egcs</em> introduces a new option, <tt>-Os</tt> which
optimizes for space.  This is roughly comparable to the old
<tt>-O2</tt> behavior.

may remove <em>gcc</em> once egcs is bootstrapped and working.
</p>

<p>
On a related note, the perl changes mentioned in <a href="#2.5.1">2.5.1</a>

</p>
<pre>
# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/cpp &amp;&amp; make install

<p>And try the make build again.</p>

<a name="2.5.2.8"></a>
<h5>
2.5.2.8 - make obj fails
</h5>

<p>
If your <em>make obj</em> fails, citing errors in a Makefile, your
makefile includes are likely out of date. For example:

"Makefile", line 30: Missing dependency operator
"Makefile", line 32: if-less endif
"Makefile", line 32: Need an operator
Fatal errors encountered -- cannot continue

</pre>

<p>
This can be solved by rebuilding the makefile includes. Do a:
</p>

<pre>
cd /usr/src/share/mk &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<p>
and try the build again.

<li> Uses <tt>u_int32_t</tt> instead of longs (nicer on the alpha).  
Note: the man page used to lie about setting invalid/unused fields to -1.  
SunOS does that but our code never has.
</li>

<li> Gets rid of <tt>f_type</tt> completely.  It hasn't been used since NetBSD 
0.9, and having it there but always 0 is confusing.  It is conceivable
that this may cause some old code to not compile, but that is better
than silently breaking.
</li>

<li> Adds a <tt>mount_info</tt> union that contains the <tt>FSTYPE_args</tt>
struct.  This means that <em>mount</em> can now tell you all the options a 
filesystem was mounted with.  This is especially nice for NFS.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Other changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li> The linux statfs emulation didn't convert between BSD fs names
and linux <tt>f_type</tt> numbers.  Now it does, since the BSD <tt>f_type</tt>
number is useless to linux apps (and has been removed anyway)
</li>

<li> FreeBSD's struct statfs is different from ours (both old and new)
and thus needs conversion.  Previously, the OpenBSD syscalls
were used without any real translation.
</li>

<li> <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mount&amp;sektion=8">mount(8)</a>
will now show extra info when invoked with no arguments.
However, to see <em>everything</em> you need to use the -v (verbose) flag. 
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
2.5.4: Link to the new 2.6 directory.
</h3>

<p>
When upgrading to 2.6 you'll need to create one simple link for gcc.
</p>

<pre>
   cd /usr/lib/gcc-lib
   ln -s ${ARCH}-unknown-openbsd2.5 ${ARCH}-unknown-openbsd2.6
</pre>

<h3>
2.5.5: After an <strong>(U)</strong>pgrade, extraction of <em>base26.tar.gz</em>
fails with a message:
</h3>

<p>
<em>tar: Unable to remove directory ./usr/include/machine &lt;Directory
not empty&gt;
</em>
</p>

<p>In 2.5, <tt>/usr/include/machine</tt> was a directory, and
<tt>/usr/include/i386</tt> was a link to it. In 2.6, this situation
is reversed.
</p>

<p>
To correct the problem, escape to the shell, remove the <tt>/usr/include/machine</tt> directory, and retry the upgrade.

<h2>Upgrading from 2.4</h2>

<a name="2.4.1"></a>
<h3>2.4.1: Man page changes</h3>
<p>
Several man pages were moved from section 1 to later sections.
Unfortunately, if the old man pages are left in section 1, unwary
users will not see the latest version of the page.
</p>

<p>
The following pages should be removed:
</p>
<pre>
/usr/share/man/cat1/ipf.0
/usr/share/man/cat1/ipnat.0
/usr/share/man/cat1/ipsecadm.0
</pre>

<a name="2.4.2"></a>
<h3>2.4.2: <em>cap_mkdb</em> syntax changed</h3>

<p>
<strong>Symptom:</strong>
</p>

<p>
A <em>make build</em> resulted in an error like this:
</p>

<pre>
cap_mkdb -i -f terminfo terminfo.src
cap_mkdb: illegal option -- i
usage: cap_mkdb [-v] [-f outfile] file1 [file2 ...]
*** Error code 1
</pre>

<p>
<strong>Fix:</strong>
</p>

<p>
The syntax for invoking <em>cap_mkdb</em> has changed slightly.
Before doing a <em>make build</em>, rebuild cap_mkdb from the latest
sources:
</p>

<pre>
# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/cap_mkdb
# make clean &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<p>
The make build should then run to completion
</p>


<a name="2.4.3"></a>
<h3>2.4.3: Snake</h3>
<p>
You will need to remove the contents of the obj directory before
upgrading <code>/usr/src/games/snake</code>.
</p>
 
<a name="2.3"></a>
<h2>Upgrading from 2.3</h2>

<a name="2.3.1"></a>
<h3>
2.3.1: New User: <em>named</em>
</h3>

<p>
After 2.3, the <em>named</em> DNS daemon was moved to a chroot jail.
To make this change possible, the <em>named</em> user was created.
If you do not have it already, you will need to create this user to
ensure that all directories get created properly during the build process.
</p>

<p>
Add the following entry to /etc/passwd using <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=vipw&amp;sektion=8">vipw(8)</a>:
</p>

<pre>
named:*:70:70::0:0:BIND Daemon:/var/named:/sbin/nologin
</pre>

<p>
Add the following to /etc/group:
</p>

<pre>
named:*:70:
</pre>


<a name="2.3.2"></a>
<h3>
2.3.2: I tried the build, but it failed when trying to compile
<em>ssleay</em>.
</h3>

<p>
You are likely missing an entry for the <em>named</em> user in your
password file.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Short Answer:</strong>
</p>

<p>
Create this user prior to the build.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Long Answer:</strong>
</p>

<p>
The <em>named</em> user is required in order to set permissions
correctly.  If this user is missing, part of the build process fails.
If you capture your build to a file (say, with a <em>make build
&amp;&gt;/tmp/build.log</em>) you will notice the following message:
</p>

<pre>
(cd /usr/src/etc &amp;&amp; make DESTDIR=/ distrib-dirs)
install -d -o root -g wheel -m 755 /
mtree -def mtree/4.4BSD.dist -p // -u

mtree: unknown user named
mtree: failed at line 1632 of the specification
*** Error code 1 (ignored)
</pre>

<p>
Unfortunately for us, the build continued happily on its way,
totally ignoring the fact that an error occurred.
</p>

<p>
If the <em>named</em> user exists, mtree works properly:
</p>

<pre>
missing: ./var/named (created)
missing: ./var/named/dev (created)
missing: ./var/named/etc (created)
missing: ./etc/afs (created)
missing: ./etc/ssl (created)
missing: ./etc/ssl/private (created)
missing: ./usr/obj (not created: File exists)
missing: ./usr/share/doc/html (created)
missing: ./usr/share/doc/html/lynx_help (created)
missing: ./usr/share/doc/html/lynx_help/keystrokes (created)
missing: ./usr/share/doc/usd/13.viref (created)
missing: ./usr/share/man/cat4/powerpc (created)
missing: ./usr/share/man/man4/alpha (created)
missing: ./usr/share/man/man4/pmax (created)
missing: ./usr/share/man/man4/powerpc (created)
missing: ./usr/share/tmac/mdoc (created)
missing: ./var/www/htdocs/manual/vhosts (created)
missing: ./usr/include/ssl (created)
</pre>

<p>
The reason for the fail, then, is that the <em>/usr/include/ssl</em>
directory was never created. Without the header files, the
<em>ssleay</em> build fails.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Fix:</strong>
</p>

<p>
Create the <em>named</em> user and group. Remove <em>/usr/include/ssl</em>,
<em>/var/named</em>, and any other directory from the list above that was
mistakenly created as a normal file by the <em>make build</em>.
</p>


<a name="2.3.3"></a>
<h3>
2.3.3: I tried the build, but it failed when trying to make something for the
PowerPC.
</h3>

<p>
Your directory tree is incomplete. Specifically, the 
<tt>/usr/share/man/cat4/powerpc</tt> directory is missing. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Quick Fix:</strong>
</p>

<p>
Create this directory and proceed with the compilation
</p>

<p>
<strong>Complete Fix:</strong>
</p>

<p>
Create the entire directory tree. Do a:
</p>

<pre>
# cd /usr/src/etc &amp;&amp; make DESTDIR=/ distrib-dirs
</pre>

<p>
You will likely see an output like the following:
</p>

<pre>
install -d -o root -g wheel -m 755 /
mtree -def mtree/4.4BSD.dist -p // -u

missing: ./var/named (created)
missing: ./var/named/dev (created)
missing: ./var/named/etc (created)
missing: ./etc/afs (created)
missing: ./etc/ssl (created)
missing: ./etc/ssl/private (created)
missing: ./usr/obj (not created: File exists)
missing: ./usr/share/doc/html (created)

missing: ./usr/share/doc/usd/13.viref (created)
missing: ./usr/share/man/cat4/powerpc (created)
missing: ./usr/share/man/man4/alpha (created)
missing: ./usr/share/man/man4/pmax (created)
missing: ./usr/share/man/man4/powerpc (created)
missing: ./usr/share/tmac/mdoc (created)
missing: ./var/www/htdocs/manual/vhosts (created)
missing: ./usr/include/ssl (created)
</pre>

<p>
Note that /usr/share/man/cat4/powerpc was one of the directories created by this process.
