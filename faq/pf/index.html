<p>
Packet Filter (from here on referred to as PF) is OpenBSD's system
for filtering TCP/IP traffic and doing Network Address Translation. PF
is also capable of normalizing and conditioning TCP/IP traffic and
providing bandwidth control and packet prioritization. PF has been a
part of the GENERIC OpenBSD kernel since OpenBSD 3.0. Previous OpenBSD
releases used a different firewall/NAT package which is no longer
supported.

<p>
PF was originally developed by Daniel Hartmeier and is now maintained and
developed by Daniel and the rest of the OpenBSD team.  

<p>
This set of documents is intended as a general introduction to the
PF system as run on OpenBSD.  It is intended to be used as a supplement
to the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi">man pages</a>, not
as a replacement for them. 
This document covers all of PF's major features. 
For a complete and in-depth view of what PF can do, please start by
reading the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf&amp;sektion=4&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4"
>pf(4)</a> man page.

<p>
As with the rest of the FAQ, this document is focused on users of <a
href="../../34.html">OpenBSD 3.4</a>. As PF is always growing and
developing, there are changes and enhancements between the 3.4-release
version and the version in OpenBSD-current. The reader is advised to see
the man pages for the version of OpenBSD they are currently working
with.
