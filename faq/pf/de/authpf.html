<h2>Introduction</h2>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=authpf&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4"
>Authpf(8)</a> is a user shell for authenticating gateways. An
authenticating gateway is just like a regular network gateway (a.k.a. a
router) except that users must first authenticate themselves to the
gateway before it will allow traffic to pass through it. When a user's
shell is set to <tt>/usr/sbin/authpf</tt> (i.e., instead of setting a
user's shell to
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ksh&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4"
>ksh(1)</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=csh&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4"
>csh(1)</a>, etc) and the user logs in using SSH, authpf will make the
necessary changes to the active  
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf&amp;sektion=4&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4"
>pf(4)</a> ruleset so that the user's traffic is passed through the
filter and/or translated using Network Address Translation or
redirection. Once the user logs out or their session is disconnected,
authpf will remove any rules loaded for the user and kill any stateful
connections the user has open. Because of this, the ability of the user
to pass traffic through the gateway only exists while the user keeps
their SSH session open. 

<p>
Authpf alters the  
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf&amp;sektion=4&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4"
>pf(4)</a> ruleset by adding rules to a 
<a href="anchors.html#named">named ruleset</a> attached to an
<a href="anchors.html">anchor point</a>. Each time a user authenticates,
authpf creates a new named ruleset and loads the preconfigured
<a href="filter.html">filter</a>, <a href="nat.html"><tt>nat</tt></a>,
<a href="nat.html#binat"><tt>binat</tt></a>, and 
<a href="rdr.html"><tt>rdr</tt></a> rules into it. The rules that authpf
loads can be configured on a per-user or global basis.

<p>
Example uses of authpf include:
<ul>
<li>Requiring users to authenticate before allowing Internet access.
<li>Granting certain users -- such as administrators -- access to
restricted parts of the network.
<li>Allowing only known users to access the rest of the network or
Internet from a wireless network segment.
<li>Allowing workers from home, on the road, etc., access to resources on
the company network.  Users outside the office can not only open access
to the company network, but can also be redirected to particular
resources (e.g., their own desktop) based on the username they
authenticate with.
<li>In a setting such as a library or other place with public Internet
terminals, PF may be configured to allow limited Internet access to
guest users. Authpf can then be used to provide registered users with
complete access.
</ul>

<p>
Authpf logs the username and IP address of each user who authenticates
successfully as well as the start and end times of their login session
via
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=syslogd&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4"
>syslogd(8)</a>. By using this information, an administrator can
determine who was logged in when and also make users accountable for
their network traffic.

<a name="config"></a>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
The basic steps needed to configure authpf are outlined here. For a
complete description of authpf configuration, please refer to the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=authpf&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4"
>authpf man page</a>.

<a name="linkmain"></a>
<h3>Linking Authpf into the Main Ruleset</h3>
Authpf is linked into the main ruleset by using <tt>anchor</tt> rules:
<blockquote>
<tt>
nat-anchor authpf<br>
rdr-anchor authpf<br>
binat-anchor authpf<br>
anchor authpf<br>
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Wherever the <tt>anchor</tt> rules are placed within the ruleset is
where PF will branch off from the main ruleset to evaluate the authpf
rules. It's not necessary for all four <tt>anchor</tt> rules to be
present; for example, if authpf hasn't been setup to load any
<tt>nat</tt> rules, the <tt>nat-anchor</tt> rule can be omitted.

<a name="loadrules"></a>
<h3>Configuring Loaded Rules</h3>
Authpf loads its rules from one of two files:
<ul>
<li><tt>/etc/authpf/users/$USER/authpf.rules</tt>
<li><tt>/etc/authpf/authpf.rules</tt>
</ul>

<p>
The first file contains rules that are only loaded when the user
<tt>$USER</tt> (which is replaced with the user's username) logs in. The
per-user rule configuration is used when a specific user -- such as an
administrator -- requires a set of rules that is different than the
default set.  The second file contains the default rules which are
loaded for any user that doesn't have their own <tt>authpf.rules</tt>
file. If the user-specific file exists, it will override the default
file. At least one of the files must exist or authpf will not run. 

<p>
Filter and translation rules have the same syntax as in any other PF
ruleset with one exception: Authpf allows for the use of two predefined
macros:
<ul>
<li><tt>$user_ip</tt> - the IP address of the logged in user
<li><tt>$user_id</tt> - the username of the logged in user
</ul>

<p>
It's recommended practice to use the <tt>$user_ip</tt> macro to only
permit traffic through the gateway from the authenticated user's
computer.

<a name="acl"></a>
<h3>Access Control Lists</h3>
Users can be prevented from using authpf by creating a file in the
<tt>/etc/authpf/banned/</tt> directory and naming it after the username
that is to be denied access.  The contents of the file will be displayed
to the user before authpf disconnects them. This provides a handy way to
notify the user of why they're disallowed access and who to contact to
have their access restored.

<p>
Conversely, it's also possible to allow only specific users access by
placing usernames in the <tt>/etc/authpf/authpf.allow</tt> file.  If the
<tt>/etc/authpf/authpf.allow</tt> file does not exist or "<tt>*</tt>" is
entered into the file, then authpf will permit access to any user who
successfully logs in via SSH as long as they are not explicitly banned.

<p>
If authpf is unable to determine if a username is allowed or denied, it
will print a brief message and then disconnect the user. An entry in
<tt>/etc/authpf/banned/</tt> always overrides an entry in
<tt>/etc/authpf/authpf.allow</tt>.

<a name="shell"></a>
<h3>Assigning Authpf as a User's Shell</h3>
In order for authpf to work it must be assigned as the user's login
shell. When the user successfully authenticates to
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4"
>sshd(8)</a>, authpf will be executed as the user's shell. It will then
check if the user is allowed to use authpf, load the rules from the
appropriate file, etc.

<p>
There are a couple ways of assigning authpf as a user's shell:
<ol>
<li>Manually for each user using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=chsh&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4"
>chsh(1)</a>, 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=vipw&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4"
>vipw(8)</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=useradd&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4"
>useradd(8)</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=usermod&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4"
>usermod(8)</a>, etc.
<li>By assigning users to a login class and changing the class's 
<tt>shell</tt> option in
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=login.conf&amp;sektion=5&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4"
><tt>/etc/login.conf</tt></a>.
</ol>

<a name="wholog"></a>
<h2>Seeing Who is Logged In</h2>
Once a user has successfully logged in and authpf has adjusted the PF
rules, authpf changes its process title to indicate the username and IP
address of the logged in user:
<pre>
    # ps -ax | grep authpf
    23664 p0  Is+     0:00.11 -authpf: charlie@192.168.1.3 (authpf)
</pre>

<p>
Here the user <tt>charlie</tt> is logged in from the machine
192.168.1.3.  By sending a SIGTERM signal to the authpf process, the
user can be forcefully logged out. Authpf will also remove any rules
loaded for the user and kill any stateful connections the user has open.
<pre>
    # kill -TERM 23664
</pre>

<a name="moreinfo"></a>
<h2>More Information</h2>
For a complete description of authpf operation, please refer to the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=authpf&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4"
>authpf man page</a>.

<a name="example"></a>
<h2>Example</h2>
Authpf is being used on an OpenBSD gateway to authenticate users on a
wireless network which is part of a larger campus network. Once a user
has authenticated, assuming they're not on the banned list, they will be
permitted to SSH out and to browse the web (including secure web sites)
in addition to accessing either of the campus DNS servers.

<p>
The <tt>/etc/authpf/authpf.rules</tt> file contains the following rules:<br>
<br>

<table border=0 width="650">
<tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
<pre>
wifi_if = "wi0"
dns_servers = "{ 10.0.1.56, 10.0.2.56 }"

pass in quick on $wifi_if proto udp from $user_ip to $dns_servers \
   port domain keep state
pass in quick on $wifi_if proto tcp from $user_ip to port { ssh, http, \
   https } flags S/SA keep state
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The administrative user <tt>charlie</tt> needs to be able to access the
campus SMTP and POP3 servers in addition to surfing the web and using
SSH. The following rules are setup in
<tt>/etc/authpf/users/charlie/authpf.rules</tt>:<br>
<br>

<table border=0 width="650">
<tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
<pre>
wifi_if = "wi0"
smtp_server = "10.0.1.50"
pop3_server = "10.0.1.51"
dns_servers = "{ 10.0.1.56, 10.0.2.56 }"

pass in quick on $wifi_if proto udp from $user_ip to $dns_servers \
   port domain keep state
pass in quick on $wifi_if proto tcp from $user_ip to $smtp_server \
   port smtp flags S/SA keep state
pass in quick on $wifi_if proto tcp from $user_ip to $pop3_server \
   port pop3 flags S/SA keep state
pass in quick on $wifi_if proto tcp from $user_ip to port { ssh, http, \
   https } flags S/SA keep state
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The main ruleset -- located in <tt>/etc/pf.conf</tt> -- is setup
as follows:<br>
<br>

<table border=0 width="650">
<tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
<pre>
# macros
wifi_if = "wi0"
ext_if  = "fxp0"

scrub in all

# filter
block drop all

pass out quick on $ext_if proto tcp from $wifi_if:network flags S/SA \
   modulate state
pass out quick on $ext_if proto { udp, icmp } from $wifi_if:network \
   keep state

pass in quick on $wifi_if proto tcp from $wifi_if:network to $wifi_if \
   port ssh flags S/SA keep state

anchor authpf in on $wifi_if
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The ruleset is very simple and does the following:
<ul>
<li>Block everything (default deny).
<li>Pass outgoing TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic on the external interface 
from the wireless network.
<li>Pass incoming SSH traffic from the wireless network destined for the
gateway itself. This rule is necessary to permit users to log in.
<li>Create the anchor point "authpf" for incoming traffic on the wireless
interface. 
</ul>

<p>
The idea behind the main ruleset is to block everything and allow the
least amount of traffic through as possible. Traffic is free to flow out
on the external interface but is blocked from entering the wireless
interface by the default deny policy. Once a user authenticates,
their traffic is permitted to pass in on the wireless interface
and to then flow through the gateway into the rest of the network. The
<tt>quick</tt> keyword is used throughout so that PF doesn't have to
evaluate each named ruleset when a new connection passes through the
gateway.
