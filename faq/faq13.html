<h1>13.1 - What is IPSec?</h1>
</a>
<P>
IPSec is a set of extensions to the IP protocol family.   It provides
cryptographic security services.  These services allow for authentication,
integrity, access control, and confidentiality.  IPSec provides
similar services as SSL, but at the network layer, in a way that is completely
transparent to your applications, and much more powerful (they don't have to
have any knowledge of IPSec.)  Also see <A HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc2401.html">RFC 2401</a>.
<P>
Before you start using IPSec, we strongly recommend that you check out
the "recommended reading" of <A HREF="faq6.html">part 6</a> of the FAQ.
In particular, if you don't already understand it, the <A HREF="http://www.3com.com/nsc/501302s.html">Understanding
IP Addressing</a> document is highly recommended.
<P>
In a logical sense, IPSec works in any of these three ways:
<UL>
<LI>Host-to-Host
<LI>Host-to-Network
<LI>Network-to-Network
</UL>
Of course, in every scenario that involves a network, we mean to imply
router.  As in, Host-to-Router (and this router controls and encrypts
traffic for a particular <i>Network</i>.)
<P>
As you can see, IPSec can be used to tunnel traffic for VPN connections.
However, its utility reaches beyond VPNs.  With a central Internet Key Exchange
registry, every machine on the internet could talk to another one
and employ powerful encryption and authentication!
<p>
<a name= "13.2">
<h1>13.2 - That's nice, but why do I want to use IPSec?</h1>
</a>
<P>
The internet protocol, IP, aka IPv4, does not inherently provide any protection
to your transferred data.  It does not even guarantee that the
sender is who he says he is.  IPSec tries to remedy this.  These services 
are considered distinct, but the IPSec supports them in a uniform manner. 
<P>
<h4>Confidentiality</h4> Make sure it is hard for anyone but the receiver
to understand what data has been communicated.  You do not want
anyone to see your passwords when logging into a remote machine
over the Internet.
<P>
<h4>Integrity</h4> Guarantee that the data does not get changed on the
way.  If you are on a line carrying invoicing data you probably
want to know that the amounts and account numbers are correct and
not altered while in-transit.
<P>
<h4>Authenticity</h4> Sign your data so that others can see that it is really
you that sent it.  It is clearly nice to know that documents
are not forged.
<P>
<h4>Replay protection</h4> We need ways to ensure a transaction can only
be carried out once unless we are authorized to repeat it.  I.e. it
should not be possible for someone to record a transaction, and
then replaying it verbatim, in order to get an effect of multiple
transactions being received by the peer.  Consider the attacker has
got to know what the traffic is all about by other means than
cracking the encryption, and that the traffic causes events
favourable for him, like depositing money into his account.  We
need to make sure he cannot just replay that traffic later.
<i>WARNING: as per the standards specification, replay protection is not
performed when using manual-keyed IPsec (e.g., when using <A
HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ipsecadm&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">ipsecadm(8)</a>)</i>.
<p>
<a name= "13.3">
<h1>13.3 - What are the protocols behind IPSec?</h1>
</a>
<P>
IPSec provides confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and replay
protection through two new protocols.  These protocols are called AH,
Authentication header, and ESP, Encapsulated security payload.
<P>
AH provides authentication, integrity, and replay protection (but not
confidentiality). Its main difference with ESP is that AH also secures
parts of the IP header of the packet (like the source/destination
addresses).
<P>
ESP can provide authentication, integrity, replay protection, and
confidentiality of the data (it secures everything in the packet that follows
the IP header). Replay protection requires authentication and integrity
(these two go always together). Confidentiality (encryption) can be used
with or without authentication/integrity. Similarly, one could use
authentication/integrity with or without confidentiality.
<P>
<a name= "13.4">
<h1>13.4 - On the wire format</h1>

<P>The <B>Authentication Header
</B>(AH) comes after the basic IP&nbsp;header and contains cryptographically
secured Hashes of the data and Identification information. The hashes can
also cover the invariant parts of the IP&nbsp;header itself. There are
several differnt RFCs giving a choice of actual algorythms to use in the
AH, however they all must follow the guidlines specified in <A HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc2402.html">RFC2402</A>.</P>

<P>The <B>Encapsulating
Security Payload</B> (ESP) header, allows for rewriting of the payload
in encrypted form. The ESP header does not consider the fields of the IP
header before it and therefore amkes no guarantees about anything except
the payload. The various types of ESP applicable must follow <A HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc2406.html">RFC2406</A>.
An ESP header can also provide Authentication for the payload, (but not
the outer header).</P>

<P>An orthogonal (mostly) division of IPSec functionality is applied depending
on whether the endpoint doing the IPSec encapsulation is the original source
of the data or a gateway:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Transport</B> mode is used by a host that is generating the packets.
In transport mode, the security headers are added before the transport
layer (e.g . TCP, UDP) headers, before the IP header is prepended to the
packet. In other words an AH&nbsp;added to the packet will cover the hashing
of the TCP header and some fields of the end-to-end IP header, and an ESP
header will cover the encryption of the TCP&nbsp;header and the data, but
not the end-to-end IP&nbsp;header.</LI>

<LI><B>Tunnel </B>mode is used when the end-to-end IP&nbsp;header is already
attached to the packet, and one of the ends of the secure connection is
only a gateway. In this mode, the AH&nbsp;and ESP headers are used to cover
the entire packet including the end-to-end header, and a new IP&nbsp;header
is repended to the packet that covers just the hop to the other end of
the secure connection (though that may of course be several IP hops away).</LI>
</UL>

<P>IPSec secured links are defined in terms of <B>Security Associations
</B>(SAs). Each SA is defined for a single unidirectional flow of data,
and usually (ignoring multicast) from one single point to another, covering
trafic distiguishable by some <B>unique selector</B>. All traffic flowing
over a single SA is treated the same. Some traffic may be subject to several
SAs, each of which applies some transform. Groups of SAs are called an
SA <B>Bundle</B>. Incoming packets can be assigned to a particular SA by
the three defining fields, (<B>Destination IPaddess, Security Paramiter
Index, Security protocol)</B> SPI can be considered a cookie that is handed
out by the reciever of the SA when the parameters of the connection are
negotiated. and the protocol must be either AH&nbsp;or ESP. Since the IP
address of the reciever is part of the tripple, this is a guaranteed unique
value. They can be found from the outer IP header and the first security
header (which contains the SPI and the protocol).</P>

<P>An example of a tunnel mode AH packet is:</P>

<P><B>[IPHDR][IPoptions][AH]</B>[IPHDR2][IPoptions][TCP][data]</P>

<P>An example of a transport mode AH packet is:</P>

<P><B>[IPHDR][IPoptions][AH]</B>[TCP][data]</P>

<P>Because an ESP&nbsp;header cannot authenticate the outer IP header,
it is useful to combine an AH&nbsp;and an ESP header to get the following:</P>

<P><B>[IPHDR][IPoptions][AH][ESP]</B><I>[TCP][data]</I></P>

<P>This is called <B>Transport Adjacency</B>. The tunnelling version would
look like:</P>

<P><B>[IPHDR][IPoptions][AH][ESP]</B><I>[IPHDR2][IPoptions][TCP][data]</I></P>

<P>However it is not specifically mentionned in the RFC. As with Transport
adjacency, this would authenticate the entire packet except a few headers
in the IP header and also encrypt the payload, (seen in italics). When
an AH&nbsp;and an ESP&nbsp;header are diectly applied together like this,
the order of the headers should be as shown. It is possible in tunnel mode,
to do arbitrary recursive encapsulation so that order is not specified.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Administrative Interface. (Sample implementation)</FONT></B></P>

<P>How the IPSec systems and gateways are configured is to some extent
left to the designer, however the RFC has some strong recomendations as
to how this should be implemented, so as to minimise confusion.</P>

<P>There are two administrative entities that control what happens to a
packet. One is the <B>Security Association Batabase </B>(SAD) and the other
is the <B>Security Policy Database</B> (SPD). Each interface supporting
IPSec should have a logically separate SAD and SPD.</P>

<P>They are similar in that given a number of selectors that describe some
traffic, they will deliver an entry that describes the processing needed.
however the SPD&nbsp;is two steps removed from the actual processing. The
SPD&nbsp;is used for outgoing packets, to decide what SAD entries should
be used, and the SAD entries in turn describe the actual process and the
parameters for it. The SPD entries specify the already created SAD entries
to use (if it's a bundle there can be more than 1), but if there is not
already a suitable one, it is used to create new ones. The fields of the
SA being created can be taken either from the SPD entry or from the packet
that initialted the creation. </P>

<P>Outgoing packets go from the SPD entry tothe specific SA, to get encoding
parameters. Incoming packates get to the correct SA directly using the
SPI/DEST/Proto tripple, and from there get to the SPD entry.</P>

<P>The SPD can also specify what traffic should bypass IPSec and what should
be dropped, so it must also be consulted for incoming non-IPSec traffic.
SPD entries must be explicitly ordered as several might match a particular
packet, and the processing must be reproducible.</P>

<P>The SPD can be though of as similar to a packet filter where the actions
decided upon are the activation of SA processes. Selectors can include
src and dest address, port numbers if relevant, application and user IDs
if available (only on host based transport SAs), hostnames, security sensitivity
levels, protocols etc.</P>

<P>An SAD entry would include:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Dest IP address</LI>

<LI>Ipsec proto (SA&nbsp;or ESP)</LI>

<LI>SPI&nbsp;(cookie)</LI>

<LI>Sequnce counter</LI>

<LI>Seq O/F flag</LI>

<LI>anti-replay window info</LI>

<LI>AH&nbsp;type and info</LI>

<LI>ESP&nbsp;type and info</LI>

<LI>Lifetime info</LI>

<LI>tunnel/transport mode flags</LI>

<LI>PATH MTU&nbsp;info</LI>
</UL>

<P>An SPD entry would contain:</P>

<UL>
<LI>pointer to active SAs</LI>

<LI>Selector fields</LI>
</UL>

<P>Each <B>SA</B> can define one ESP&nbsp;header and one AH header. so
an IPSec session must have one or the other or both, but cannot be defined
with neither, otherwise there would be no headers to specify the <B>SPI</B>
to look up the <B>SA</B>. The RFC doesn't say what would happen if the
AH&nbsp;and ESP&nbsp;headers dissagree about the SPI value. One would presume
this would imply multiple SA's in a bundle.</P>

<P>These values and SAD entries should be addable by hand by some (implementation
dependent) interface, however the IETF has also defined automatic mechanisms
for initialisation of sessions and such things as key exchange. These are
defined in <A HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc2407.html">RFC2407</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc2408.html">RFC2408,</A> and <A HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc2409.html">RFC2409</A></P>


<a name= "13.5">
<h1>13.5 - How do I setup IPSec with manual keying?</h1>
</a>
<P>
Manual keying is the easiest way to get started with IPSec.
You can setup encryption between networks, to create VPNs using this
method.  After you have read this section, you may want to
investigate using <A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/share/ipsec/rc.vpn?rev=1.3">/usr/share/ipsec/rc.vpn</a>
to set this up for you automatically.
<P>
First, you need to turn on IP AH and IP ESP options in the OpenBSD
kernel.  There is a nice sysctl to do this.
<ul><tt>
# <b>sysctl -w net.inet.esp.enable=1</b><BR>
net.inet.esp.enable: 0 -> 1<br>
# <b>sysctl -w net.inet.ah.enable=1</b><br>
net.inet.ah.enable: 0 -> 1
</ul></tt>
You can edit <tt>/etc/sysctl.conf</tt> to turn these on at boot time.
<P>
Now, you need to setup SAs, or Security Associations.
A Security Association is a combination of your IP addresses, an SPI, and
your security protocol (AH and/or ESP.)  The IP addresses are that of both
your own and your destination.  The SPI, or Security Parameter Index, is a
number that OpenBSD uses to classify different SAs.
<P>
<I>These examples only use ESP to encrypt your traffic.  They do not provide
authentication, but that's OK, because we are tunneling.</i>
<P>
<ul>
<tt>
# <b>ipsecadm new esp -spi SPI_OUT -src MY_EXTERNAL_IP -dst PEER_EXTERNAL_IP
-forcetunnel -enc blf -auth sha1 -key ENC_KEY -authkey AUTH_KEY</b>
</tt>
</ul>
<P>
Let's put this into practice with two routers, 192.168.5.1 and 192.168.25.9.
<P>
On Host 192.168.5.1:
<ul>
<tt>
# <b>ipsecadm new esp -spi 1000 -src 192.168.5.1 -dst 192.168.25.9 -forcetunnel -enc blf -auth sha1 -key 7762d8707255d974168cbb1d274f8bed4cbd3364 -authkey 6a20367e21c66e5a40739db293cf2ef2a4e6659f</b>
</tt>
</ul>
On Host 192.168.25.9:
<UL>
<tt>
# <b>ipsecadm new esp -spi 1001 -src 192.168.25.9 -dst 192.168.5.1 -forcetunnel -enc blf -auth sha1 -key 7762d8707255d974168cbb1d274f8bed4cbd3364 -authkey 6a20367e21c66e5a40739db293cf2ef2a4e6659f</b>
</tT>
</ul>
<P>
Notice that the SPIs are different.  See <A HREF="#13.4">On the wire format</a> for a complete description of what the SPI is and where it is used.
<P>
Now that you have your Security Associations in place,
set up your flows.
<P>
On 192.168.5.1:
<ul>
<tt>
# <b>ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 192.168.25.9 -spi 1000
-addr 192.168.5.1 255.255.255.255 192.168.25.9 255.255.255.255 -local</b>
</tt></ul>
On 192.168.25.9:
<ul>
<tt>
# <b>ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 192.168.5.1 -spi 1001
-addr 192.168.25.9 255.255.255.255 192.168.5.1 255.255.255.255 -local</b>
</tt></ul>
<p>
This is a simple way to start using IPSec.
<P>
You can use IPSec to tunnel private IP address spaces over the Internet.
Here is a good example... We want to tunnel 192.168.99.0/24, which is behind
208.1.1.1, to 208.1.2.0/24 and 208.1.5.0/24 which are behind 208.2.2.2.
These examples were generated using the <A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/share/ipsec/rc.vpn?rev=1.3">rc.vpn</a> script.
<P>
As you can see, with IPSec, you have to specify <b>exactly</b> what you want done.
It won't guess for you.  Look at these examples...
<h2>On 208.1.1.1:</h2>
First, set up the security associations (SAs):<BR>
(This sets up the SPIs, encryption methods, and keys.) 
<UL><tt>
# <b>ipsecadm new esp -src 208.1.1.1 -dst 208.2.2.2 -forcetunnel -spi 1001 -enc blf -auth sha1 -key 7762d8707255d974168cbb1d274f8bed4cbd3364 -authkey 67e21c66e5a40739db293cf2ef2a4e6659f</b><br>
# <b>ipsecadm new esp -src 208.2.2.2 -dst 208.1.1.1 -forcetunnel -spi 1000 -enc blf -auth sha1 -key 7762d8707255d974168cbb1d274f8bed4cbd3364 -authkey 67e21c66e5a40739db293cf2ef2a4e6659f</b><br>
</ul></tt>
Next, setup a flow from 208.1.1.1 to 208.2.2.2
<ul><tt>
# <b>ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 208.2.2.2 -spi 1001 -addr 208.1.1.1 255.255.255.255 208.2.2.2 255.255.255.255 -local</b><br>
</ul></tt>
Next, setup a flow from 208.1.2.0/24, which is behind 208.2.2.2, to 192.168.99.0/24
<ul><tt>
# <b>ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 208.2.2.2 -spi 1001 -addr 192.168.99.0 255.255.255.0 208.1.2.0 255.255.255.0</b><BR>
</ul></tt>
Next, setup a flow from 208.1.5.0/24, which is behind 208.2.2.2, to 192.168.99.0/24
<ul><tt>
# <b>ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 208.2.2.2 -spi 1001 -addr 192.168.99.0 255.255.255.0 208.1.5.0 255.255.255.0</b><br>
</ul></tt>
Now, setup a flow from 208.1.2.0/24, which is behind 208.2.2.2 to the router 208.1.1.1.
<ul><tT>
# <b>ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 208.2.2.2 -spi 1001 -addr 208.1.1.1 255.255.255.255 208.1.2.0 255.255.255.0 -local</b><br>
</ul></tt>
OK, setup a flow from 208.1.5.0/24, which is behind 208.2.2.2, to the router 208.1.1.1
<ul><tt>
# <b>ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 208.2.2.2 -spi 1001 -addr 208.1.1.1 255.255.255.255 208.1.5.0 255.255.255.0 -local</b><br>
</ul></tt>
Finally, setup a flow from the router 208.2.2.2 to 192.168.99.0/24
<ul><tt>
# <b>ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 208.2.2.2 -spi 1001 -addr 192.168.99.0 255.255.255.0 208.2.2.2 255.255.255.255</b><br>
</ul></tt>
<P>
<h2>On 208.2.2.2:</h2>
Same as before, we setup the SAs...
<UL><TT>
# <b>ipsecadm new esp -src 208.2.2.2 -dst 208.1.1.1 -forcetunnel -spi 1000 -enc blf -auth sha1 -key 7762d8707255d974168cbb1d274f8bed4cbd3364 -authkey 67e21c66e5a40739db293cf2ef2a4e6659f</b><br>

</ul></tt>
Now, this is the reverse side...
Setup a flow from the router 208.2.2.2 to 208.1.1.1
<ul><tt>
# <b>ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 208.1.1.1 -spi 1000 -addr 208.2.2.2 255.255.255.255 208.1.1.1 255.255.255.255 -local</b><br>
</ul></tt>
Setup a flow from the network 192.168.99.0/24, which is behind 208.1.1.1, to 208.1.2.0/24
<ul><tT>

</ul></tt>
Now, setup a flow from 192.169.99.0/24, which is behind 208.1.1.1, to the router 208.2.2.2
<ul><tt>
# <b>ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 208.1.1.1 -spi 1000 -addr 208.2.2.2 255.255.255.255 192.168.99.0 255.255.255.0 -local</b><br>

We're almost done...
Two flows left to get 208.1.2.0/24 and 208.1.5.0/24 from the router 208.2.2.2

<h1>13.6 - How do I setup IPSec with isakmpd/IKE?</h1>
</a>
<P>If you are thinking about VPNs or other traditional applications
of IPSec, you probably are going to use ISAKMP.  Most commercial
implementations of IPSec do not provide any manual keying ability, 
they require you to use some form of ISAKMP.  Unfortunately, this FAQ
