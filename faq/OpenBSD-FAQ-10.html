<H2><A NAME="s10">10. <CODE>disklabel</CODE> and <CODE>fdisk</CODE></A></H2>

<P><CODE>disklabel</CODE> and <CODE>fdisk</CODE> are different in OpenBSD
than what most users are used to in different operating systems.</P>

<P>In OpenBSD, the disklabel is the core program used to modify
and view a system's hard disk. <CODE>disklabel</CODE> is used to
establish the disk's partitions as well as write the OpenBSD
disklabel to disk. <CODE>disklabel</CODE> is also used to display
which partitions are which. By running <CODE>disklabel</CODE> with
an argument like "<CODE>wd0</CODE>" (think "<CODE>disklabel wd0</CODE>")
the output will show not only what partitions of the disk
are used by OpenBSD, but also what partitions can be used to
access DOS partitions. Please note that disklabel is used by
ALL platforms that OpenBSD supports.</P>

<P>In all install procedures, disklabel is loaded up and the disk must be
partitioned. Disklabeling is done in 512-byte sectors, so have a calculator
ready <B>:-)</B></P>

<P>A typical, finished disklabel looks like this:</P>

<P>This is the disklabel from my DEC Alpha's SCSI disk ---
<CODE>/dev/sd0</CODE>. Letters "<CODE>a-e</CODE>" are the different
partitions on the disk. When the OpenBSD install procedure
fires up disklabel, it generates the top 20 lines of the label.
It's up to you (the person doing the install) to mete out the
partitions as necessary for your system. The example I give
here is pretty generic.  Different systems will want to have
different sized partitions for different uses.</P>


<P>To OpenBSD, there are a few special partition names that
are reserved and have a special purpose. Partition "<CODE>a</CODE>"
is reserved for the root file system.  Partition "<CODE>b</CODE>"
is reserved for swap space. "<CODE>c</CODE>" is reserved as a way to
access the whole, raw disk. For compatibility reasons with
other *BSD's on the i386 platform, some people choose not to
use partition "<CODE>d</CODE>". In setting up my Alpha, I left out
partition "<CODE>d</CODE>", with no great loss.</P>


<P>You don't have to be a math major to figure out how to
proclaim space using disklabel on your OpenBSD install. From
the disklabel above, the root partition ("<CODE>a</CODE>") of the
install above is roughly 80 Megabytes large. How does "163840"
represent this?</P>

<P>Some of us may remember some dimensional analysis from
chemistry.  This is much easier than finding Avagadro's
number...</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

80 * 1024 * 1024 / 512 = 163840  
M -&gt;  K  -&gt;  b -&gt; b/s  = sectors

<P>(the long way)</P>

<P>Since for us, the conversion factor will always be the same,
multiply the amount of Megs that you want in a partition by
"2048" and you'll get the amount of sectors you need to allot.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

80 * 2048 = 163840

<P>(the easy way)</P>


<P>Now that we know how to size out our partitions, we need
to know how to place them.</P>

<P>Back to our example:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#        size  offset  fstype  [fsize bsize  cpg]
  a:  163840       0  4.2BSD    1024  8192   16   # (Cyl.   0 - 156*)
  b:   92160  163840    swap                      # (Cyl. 156*- 243*)
  c: 2031705       0  unused       0     0        # (Cyl.   0 - 1934*)
  e: 1775705  256000  4.2BSD    1024  8192   16   # (Cyl. 243*- 1934*)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>You'll notice the "offset" column. That tells the disklabel
where it should start the next partition. If you notice,
the offset for the first partition is 0 (zero), and for the
following partition it is the size of the previous partition.
This is because disklabel starts counting from 0 (zero) and
not from 1 (one).</P>

<P>Remember, partition "<CODE>c</CODE>" spans the entire disk, so
it's offset is 0 (zero) and it's size is the size of the disk
in sectors.</P>

<P>The fstype column is used to write to the disklabel what kind
of filesystem should be on the disk. Notice for "<CODE>b</CODE>", the
swap partition, it's filesystem is declared as "<CODE>swap</CODE>" since
OpenBSD uses unformatted disk space for swapping.  Also not
that the "<CODE>c</CODE>" partition must not have a filesystem on it,
otherwise it will scrub the disk. Most importantly, OpenBSD
uses the 4.2BSD ffs filesystem. Partitions like the root
partition and <CODE>/usr</CODE>, etc. need to be declared as "<CODE>4.2BSD</CODE>"
in the disklabel!</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.1">10.1 fsize, bsize, and cpg</A></H2>

<P><EM>fsize</EM> is the minimum file size, a partial block that
is allocated for small files. <EM>fsize</EM> should be smaller
than <EM>bsize</EM>.  <EM>bsize</EM> is the blocksize for a normal
block of data on the partition.  <EM>cpg</EM> is the amount
of cylinders per group, which is used for when some low
level programs do mappings and other low-level functions
on a per-cylinder basis. The defaults for this are 1024,
8192, and 16, respectively. This can be changed based on
your needs. For more information, check the FFS papers
in <CODE>
<A HREF="file:/usr/share/doc/smm/03.fsck_ffs">file:/usr/share/doc/smm/03.fsck_ffs</A></CODE> for starters.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss10.2">10.2 FDISK...</A></H2>

<P>Unlike Linux, DOS, or FreeBSD, OpenBSD's fdisk is not
full-screen/interactive. fdisk is used to manipulate partitions
other than OpenBSD partitions as well as the MBR on various
hard disks. If you are sharing a disk between DOS and OpenBSD,
you can change which partition is active with fdisk. fdisk
can also be used to display the same partition information as
disklabel, although the format of the output is different.</P>
