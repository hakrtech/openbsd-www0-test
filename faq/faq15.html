<h2>15.1 - Using the OpenBSD disklabel</h2>
</p>

<p>
Be sure to check the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&sektion=8&format=html">disklabel(8)</a> man page! 
</p>

<p>
Disklabel is used to identify disks and/or partitions. The main idea behind
them is abstraction of disk hardware, since there exists several partitioning
tables. A <b>disklabel</b> is a universal partitioning table. These
labels tell the system everything about the disk, but most of it is irrelevant.
The important parts of the label are both the part that tells the disk
geometry and also the part that actually defines what partitions
exist on your disk.  This label resides on the beginning of the disk, this is to
help bootstrap code use them (since most ROM based booting reads the first sectors of the first disk). 
Disklabel can, on some systems, be used to install bootstrap code.
</p>

<p>
As an additional gain, using disklabel helps overcome architecture limitations
on disk partitioning. For example, on i386, you can only have 4 primary
partitions.  (Partitions that other operating systems, such as Windows NT
or DOS can see.)  With <b>disklabel</b>, you use one of these
'primary' partitions to store *all* of your OpenBSD partitions
(eg. 'swap', '/', '/usr' and '/var'). And you still have 3 more partitions
available for other OSs!
</p>

<p>
You can think of them as 'subpartitions' for installation purposes. But they
are a necessity for kernel disk access based on geometry. And remember to use
'b' for the swap label, and 'a' for root filesystem (default names in kernel).
(Note also that in other FAQ documents we usually refer to these OpenBSD
'subpartitions' as partitions.  Most architectures do not have two layers
of partitions like the i386 does.)
</p>

<p>
To just view the current disklabel for your disk just do:<br>

<ul><pre>
# <Strong>disklabel &lt;disk-device name&gt;</strong><br>
</pre></ul>
This will give output similar to this:<br>
</p>

<ul><pre>
# using MBR partition 3: type A6 off 64 (0x40) size 16777152 (0xffffc0)
# /dev/rwd0c:

16 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize   cpg]
  a:  2071440    65583    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl.   65*- 2120)
  b:    65520       63      swap                        # (Cyl.    0*- 65)
  c:  2654064        0    unused        0     0         # (Cyl.    0 - 2632)

</PRE></ul>

<p> 
In this example, there are 4 labels - A, B, C, J. A is one main partition, B is swap, and J is another
partition. C in all cases represents the full disk. This is helpful in showing what values in size, cyl, etc you have
to work with. But with this command you cannot change any values, you can just view. 
</p>

<p>
To be able to edit your label's interactively you would use the <b>-E</b> flag.<br>
Example:
</p>

<ul><pre>
# <strong>disklabel -E wd0</strong>
# using MBR partition 3: type A6 off 64 (0x40) size 16777152 (0xffffc0)

Treating sectors 64-16777216 as the OpenBSD portion of the disk.
You can use the 'b' command to change this.

Initial label editor (enter '?' for help at any prompt)
> <Strong>?</strong>
Available commands:
        p [unit]  - print label.
        M         - show entire OpenBSD man page for disklabel.
        e         - edit drive parameters.
        a [part]  - add new partition.
        b         - set OpenBSD disk boundaries.
        c [part]  - change partition size.
        d [part]  - delete partition.
        m [part]  - modify existing partition.
        r         - recalculate free space.
        u         - undo last change.
        s [path]  - save label to file.
        w         - write label to disk.
        q         - quit and save changes.
        x         - exit without saving changes.
        ? [cmnd]  - this message or command specific help.
Numeric parameters may use suffixes to indicate units:
        'b' for bytes, 'c' for cylinders, 'k' for kilobytes, 'm' for megabytes,
        'g' for gigabytes or no suffix for sectors (usually 512 bytes).
        Non-sector units will be rounded to the nearest cylinder.
Entering '?' at most prompts will give you (simple) context sensitive help.

<p> 
In this example we get into disklabel's interactive mode. From here we can issue the command "?" asking for help. This
gives us many commands we can use to add, delete, edit existing labels.  
</p> 

<p> 
There is a new feature on disklabel, to help installation. The '-f' flag writes a 'fstab' like file, if
given a mount point for a label. This is only used at installation.

<h2>15.2 - Using fdisk</h2>
</p>
<p>
First be sure to check the fdisk main page. 
<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">fdisk(8)</a>
</p>
<p>
Fdisk is a program to help with the maintenance of your partitions. This
program is used at install time to set up your OpenBSD partition (this
partition can contain <u>several</u> labels, each with filesystems/swap/etc.).
It can divide space on your drives and set one active. This program will
usually be used in Single User Mode ( boot -s ). Fdisk also sets the MBR on
your various hard disks.
</p>

<p>
For installation purposes, most times you'll only need <b>ONE</b> Openbsd
partition, and then using disklabel to put a swap and a filesystem on it.
</p>

<p>
To just view your partition table using fdisk just use:<br>
<ul>
<pre># <strong>fdisk fd0</strong><br>
</pre>
</ul>

Which will give an output similar to this:
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
         Disk: fd0       geometry: 80/2/18 [2880 sectors]
         Offset: 0       Signatures: 0xAA55,0x0
                  Starting        Ending
          #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
         *0: A6    0   0   1 -   79   1  18 [         0 -       2880] OpenBSD
          1: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused
          2: A7    0   0   2 -   79   1  18 [         1 -       2879] NEXTSTEP
          3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
In this example we are viewing the fdisk output of floppy drive. We can
see the OpenBSD partition (A6) and its size. The * tells us that the
OpenBSD partition is a bootable partition.
</p>

<p>
In the previous example we just viewed our information. What if we want to
edit our partition table? Well, to do so we must use the <b>-e</b> flag.
This will bring up a command line prompt to interact with fdisk.
</p>

<ul>
<PRE>
# <strong>fdisk -e wd0</strong>
Enter 'help' for information
fdisk: 1> <strong>help</strong>
        help            Command help list
        manual          Show entire OpenBSD man page for fdisk
        reinit          Re-initialize loaded MBR (to defaults)
        disk            Edit current drive stats
        edit            Edit given table entry
        flag            Flag given table entry as bootable
        update          Update machine code in loaded MBR
        select          Select extended partition table entry MBR
        print           Print loaded MBR partition table
        write           Write loaded MBR to disk
        exit            Exit edit of current MBR, without saving changes
        quit            Quit edit of current MBR, saving current changes
        abort           Abort program without saving current changes
fdisk: 1> 
</PRE>
</ul>

</p>
<p> 
It is perfectly safe in fdisk to go in and explore, just make sure to answer <Strong>N</strong> to saving
the changes and *DON'T* use the <strong>write</strong> command.
</p>

<p>Here is an overview of the commands you can use when you choose the <b>-e</b> flag.<br>
<ul>
<li><strong>help</strong>    Display a list of commands that fdisk understands in the interactive edit mode.</li>
<li><strong>reinit</strong>  Initialize the currently selected, in-memory copy of the boot block.</li>
<li><strong>disk</strong>    Display the current drive geometry that fdisk has probed. You are given a chance to edit it if you wish.</li>
<li><strong>edit</strong>    Edit a given table entry in the memory copy of the current boot block.  You may edit either in BIOS geometry mode, or in sector offsets and sizes.</li>
<li><strong>flag</strong>    Make the given partition table entry bootable. Only one entry can be marked bootable. If you 
wish to boot from an extended partition, you will need to mark the partition table entry for the extended partition as bootable.</li>
<li><strong>update</strong>  Update the machine code in the memory copy of the currently selected boot block.</li>
<li><strong>select</strong>  Select and load into memory the boot block pointed to by the extended partition table entry in the current boot block.</li>
<li><strong>print</strong>   Print the currently selected in-memory copy of the boot block and its MBR table to the terminal.</li>
<li><strong>write</strong>   Write the in-memory copy of the boot block to disk. You will be asked to confirm this operation.</li>
<li><strong>exit</strong>    Exit the current level of fdisk, either returning to the previously selected in-memory copy of a boot block, or exiting the program if there is none.</li>
<li><strong>quit</strong>    Exit the current level of fdisk, either returning to the previously selected
in-memory copy of a boot block, or exiting the program if there is none.  Unlike exit it does write the modified block out.</li>
<li><strong>abort</strong>   Quit program without saving current changes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>15.3 - Adding extra disks in OpenBSD</h2>
</p>

<p>
Well once you get your disk installed <strong>PROPERLY</strong> you need to use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">fdisk(8)</a>
(<i>i386 only</i
>) and 
<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">
disklabel(8)</a> to set
 up your
disk in OpenBSD.
<P>
For i386 folks, start with fdisk.  Other architectures can ignore this.
<UL><PRE>
# <Strong>fdisk -i sd2</strong>
</ul></pre>
This will initialize the disk's "real" partition table for exclusive use
by OpenBSD.
Next you need to create a disklabel for it.  This will seem confusing.
<UL><PRE>
# <strong>disklabel -e sd2</strong>

<i>(screen goes blank, your $EDITOR comes up)</i>
type: SCSI
<i>...bla...</i>
sectors/track: 63
total sectors: 6185088
<i>...bla...</i>
16 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize   cpg]
  c:  6185088        0    unused        0     0         # (Cyl.    0 - 6135)
  d:  1405080       63    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl.    0*- 1393*)
  e:  4779945  1405143    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl. 1393*- 6135)
</PRE></ul>
First, ignore the 'c' partition, it's always there and is for
programs like disklabel to function! 
For normal operations, fsize should always be 1024, bsize should always be 8192,
and cpg should always be 16.  Fstype is 4.2BSD.  Total sectors is
the total size of the disk.
Say this is a 3 gigabyte disk.  Three gigabytes in disk manufacturer
terms is 3000 megabytes.  So divide 6185088/3000 (use bc(1)).  You get 2061.
So to make up partition sizes for a, d, e, f, g, ... just multiply X*2061
to get X megabytes of space on that partition.   The offset for your
first new partition should be the same as the "sectors/track" reported
earlier in disklabel's output.  For us it is 63.  The offset for each
partition afterwards should be a combination of the size of each partition
and the offset of each partition (Except the C partition, since it has no
play into this equation.)
<P>
Or, if you just want one partition on the disk, say you will use the
whole thing for web storage or a home directory or something,
just take the total size of the disk and subtract the sectors per track from it.
6185088-63 = 6185025.  Your partition is
<UL><PRE>
    d:  6185025       63    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16 
</PRE></UL>
<P>
<b>If all this seems needlessly complex, you can just use disklabel -E to get
the same partitioning mode that you got on your install disk!</b>
There, you can just use "96M" to specify "96 megabytes".  (Or, if you have a disk
big enough, 96G for 96 gigs!) Unfortunately,
the -E mode uses the BIOS disk geometry, not the real disk geometry,
and often times the two are not the same.  To get around this limitation,
type 'g d' for 'geometry disk'.  (Other options are 'g b' for 'geometry bios'
and 'g u' for geometry user, or simply, what the label said before
disklabel made any changes.)
<P>
That was a lot.  But you are not finished.  
Finally, you need to create the filesystem on that disk using <a href=
"http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=newfs
&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">newfs(8)</a>.
</p>

<p>
<ul><pre>
bsd# <strong>newfs wd1a </strong></ul></pre>
</p>

<p>
Or whatever your disk was named as per OpenBSD's disk numbering scheme.  (Look at the
output from dmesg(1) to see what your disk was named by OpenBSD.)
</p>

<p>
Now figure out where you are going to mount this new partition you just created.
Say you want to put it on /u.  First, make the directory /u.  Then, mount it.
</p>

<UL><PRE>
mount /dev/wd1a /u
</PRE></UL>

<P>
Finally, add it to /etc/fstab
</p>
<UL><PRE>/dev/wd1a /u ffs rw 1 1</PRE></UL>

<p>
What if you need to migrate an existing directory like /usr/local? You should mount 
the new drive in /mnt and use cpio -pdum to copy /usr/local to the /mnt directory.
Edit the /etc/fstab file to show that the /usr/local partition is now /dev/wd1a
(your freshly formatted partition.) 
Example:
</p>

<ul>
<strong>/dev/wd1a /usr/local ffs rw 1 1</strong>
</ul>

<p>
Reboot into single user mode..<strong>boot -s</strong> Move the existing
/usr/local to /usr/local-backup (or delete it if you feel lucky) and create an
empty directory /usr/local. Then reboot the system, and whala!! the files are there!

<h2>15.4 - How to swap to a file</h2>
</p>

<p>
(Note: if you are looking to swap to a file because you are getting
&quot;virtual memory exhausted&quot; errors, you should try raising
the per-process limits first with 
csh's <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=unlimit&sektion=1&format=html">unlimit(1)</a>,
or
sh's <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ulimit&sektion=1&format=html">ulimit(1)</a>.)
</p>

<p>
With OpenBSD 2.5 came the introduction of <a
href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=swapctl&sektion=8&format=h
tml">swapctl(8)</a>, 
which made dealing with swap devices much easier. Swapping to a file doesn't require a 
custom built kernel, although that can still be done, this faq will show you how to add 
swap space both ways.
</p>

<p>
To swap to a file permanently, first make a kernel with vnd0c as swap. If you 
have wd0a as root filesystem, wd0b is the previous swap, use this line in the 
kernel configuration file (refer to compiling a new kernel if in doubt):
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
config          bsd     root on wd0a swap on wd0b and vnd0c dumps on wd0b
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
Second make the file for swap. If you want a 32MB swapfile named /newswap do:
</p>

<ul>
<strong># dd if=/dev/zero of=/newswap bs=1k count=32768</strong>
</ul>

<p>
Add a line to your /etc/fstab file to indicate where the new swap will be.
</p>

<ul>
<strong>/dev/vnd0c none swap sw 0 0</strong>
</ul>

<p>
Now boot with the new kernel. Then create the vnd0 device to use that file
as a device:
</p>

<ul>
<strong># vnconfig -c -v vnd0 /newswap</strong>
</ul>

<p>
And add it now to swap:
</p>

<ul>
<strong># swapon /dev/vnd0c</strong>
</ul>

<p>
You can now see if it is working with:
</p>

<ul>
<strong># pstat -s</strong>
</ul>

<h2>15.5 - Soft-updates</h2>
</p>

<p>
<strong>
Softupdates are experimental and are NOT recomended for regular users.
</strong>
</p>

<p>
Over the last few years Kirk McKusick has been working on something called
"soft updates". This is based on an idea proposed by Greg Ganger and Yale
Patt that imposing a partial ordering on the buffer cache opertions would
permit the requirement for synchronous writing of directory entries to be
removed from the FFS code. Thus, a large performance increase of disk
writing performance.
</p>

<p>
To enable Softupdates your kernel must have option
</p>

<p>
<strong>option FFS_SOFTUPDATES</strong>
</p>

<p>
then you need to boot into single-user mode:
</p>

<ul>
<strong>
<pre>
        boot>boot -s
        [snip]
        bsd# tunefs -s enable &lt;raw device&gt;
        bsd# reboot -n
</pre>
</strong>
</ul>

<p>
GOOD LUCK. Please direct all problem reports with as MUCH information as
possible (kernel coredumps, tracebacks, etc) to <a href="mailto:csapuntz@openbsd.org">Costa</a>.

<h2>15.6 -  When I boot after installation of OpenBSD/i386, it says "partition 3 id 0".</h2>
</p>
<p>
This means that your MBR (Master Boot Record) was not installed properly
or that your BIOS is not compatible with your current MBR. To solve this
first try to reinstall the OpenBSD boot blocks. To do so use
<a
href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=installboot&sektion=8&format=html">installboot(8)</a>.
For example, the most common usage is:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Boot from the OpenBSD bootdisk</li>
<ul>
<li># <strong>fsck /dev/rwd0a && mount /dev/wd0a /mnt </li></strong>
<li># <strong>cp /usr/mdec/boot /mnt/boot</li></strong>
<li># <strong>/usr/mdec/installboot -v /mnt/boot /usr/mdec/biosboot wd0</li></strong>
</ul>
<li>Here substitute your disk devices for rwd0a & wd0a. This will install the boot blocks again.</li>
<li>Then Reboot.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If this doesn't work you still have a few more options. So, luck hasn't
run out yet. The first is to use a bootloader such as OS-BS. The OpenBSD
cd has the os-bs bootloader included in the tools directory. If you didn't
purchase a CD-ROM, you can download os-bs from any of the OpenBSD ftp
sites.
</p>

<p>
<kbd>pub/OpenBSD/2.5/tools/osbs135.exe</kbd>
</p>

<p>
and take some time to look through the web pages at
<a href= "http://www.prz.tu-berlin.de/~wolf/os-bs.html">
          http://www.prz.tu-berlin.de/~wolf/os-bs.html</a>
</p>

<p>
There are also other commercial bootloaders or lilo that you can use for
multi-booting.
</p>

<p>
Here is a simple outline of how to get lilo onto your system.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Boot a DOS floppy and do a fdisk /MBR. Make sure you do that on the
drive you'll be booting from.</li>
<li>Boot from a linux disk and install LILO & chain it to your OpenBSD
boot block.</li>
</ul>

<h2>15.7 - How do I get a dmesg from a boot floppy?</h2>
</p>
<p>
RAMDISK images (boot floppies) do not ship with the <i>dmesg</i> utility.
They do, however, have the <code>/kern</code> filesystem mounted. To copy 
the dmesg information to a file, do a:
</p>

<pre><ul>
# <strong>cat /kern/msgbuf >mydmesg</strong>
</pre></ul>
<P>
Boot disks also have 'more' to page through the output:
<pre><ul>
# <strong>more /kern/msgbuf</strong>
</ul></pre>

<h1>15.8 - I cannot boot OpenBSD. It just says: "reading boot.. Bad magic" (Installing Bootblocks - i386 specific)</h1>
</p>

<p>
Older versions of MS-DOS can only deal with disk geometries of 1024 cylinders
or less.  Since virtually all modern disks have more than 1024
cylinders, most SCSI BIOS chips (which come on the SCSI controller card)
and IDE BIOS (which is part of the rest of the PC BIOS)
have an option (sometimes the default) to "translate" the real disk
geometry into something that fits within MS-DOS' ability.
However, not all BIOS chips "translate" the geometry in
the same way.  If you change your BIOS (either with a new motherboard
or a new SCSI controller), and the new one uses a
different "translated" geometry, you will be unable to load the
second stage boot loader (and thus unable to load the kernel).
(This is because the first stage boot loader contains a list of the blocks
that comprise /boot in terms of the original "translated" geometry.)
If you are using IDE disks, and you make changes to your BIOS settings,
you can (unknowingly) change its translation also (most IDE BIOS offer 3 different
translations.) To fix your boot block so that you can boot normally,
just put a boot floppy in your hard drive, and at the boot prompt,
type "b hd0a:/bsd" to force it to boot from the first hard disk (and not the
floppy).  Your machine should come up normally.  You now need
to update the first stage boot loader to see the new geometry
(and re-write the boot block accordingly).
<br>
Our example will assume your boot disk is sd0 (but for IDE it would be wd0, etc..):
</p>
<ul>
<pre>
# <strong>cd /usr/mdec; ./installboot /boot biosboot sd0</strong>
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
If installboot complains that it is unable to read the BIOS geometry, at
the boot> prompt you may issue the &quot;machine diskinfo&quot; (or
&quot;ma di&quot; for short) command to print the information you need.
Feed the &quot;heads&quot; and &quot;secs&quot; values to installboot's -h
and -s flags, respectively, so that the modified installboot command is
the following:
</p>
<ul><pre>
#<strong> cd /usr/mdec; ./installboot -h &lt;heads&gt; -s &lt;secs&gt; /boot biosboot sd0</strong>
</pre></ul>

<p>
If a newer version of bootblocks are required, you will need to compile these yourself. To do so simply.
</p>

<ul><pre>
# <strong>cd /sys/arch/i386/stand/</strong>
# <strong>make && make install </strong>
# <strong>cd /usr/mdec; cp ./boot /boot</strong>
# <strong>./installboot /boot biosboot sd0</strong> (or whatever device your hard disk is)
</pre></ul>
