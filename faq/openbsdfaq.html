<H2><A NAME="About" HREF="openbsdfaq_toc.html#About">1.1  What is <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG>?</A></H2>

<P>
The <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> project produces a freely available, multi-platform
4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system. Our efforts place emphasis
on portability, standardization, correctness, and security.
<STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> supports binary emulation of most binaries from
SVR4 (Solaris), FreeBSD, Linux, BSDI, SunOS, and HPUX.

</P>
<P>
More about the project goals: <a HREF="../goals.html">

<A NAME="IDX2"></A>


<H2><A NAME="Free" HREF="openbsdfaq_toc.html#Free">1.2  Is it really free?</A></H2>

<P>
<STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> is all free.  The binaries are free.  The source is
free.  All parts of <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> have reasonable copyright terms
permitting free redistribution.

</P>
<P>
More about copyright policy:  <a HREF="../policy.html">
http://www.openbsd.org/policy.html</a>.

</P>
<P>
The maintainers of <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> support the project largely
from their own pockets.  This includes the time spent programming
for the project, equipment used to support the many ports, the
network resources used to distribute <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> to you, and
the time spent answering questions and investigating users' bug
reports. The <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> developers are not independently
wealthy and even small contributions of time, equipment, and
resources make a big difference.

</P>
<P>

<H2><A NAME="Why" HREF="openbsdfaq_toc.html#Why">1.3  Why might I want to use <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG>?</A></H2>

<P>
New users frequently want to know whether <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> is
superior to some other free UNIX-like operating system.  That
question is largely un-answerable and is the subject of countless
(and useless) religious debates.  <STRONG>Do not, under any
circumstances, ask such a question on an OpenBSD mailing list.</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
Below are some reasons why we think <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> is a
useful operating system.  Whether <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> is right for
you is a question that only you can answer.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> runs on many different hardware platforms.
<LI>

<STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> developers have spent countless hours in a focused
effort to systematically eliminate security holes (and potential security
holes) from the code.
<LI>

<STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> is a full-featured UNIX-like operating system
available in source form at no charge.
<LI>

<STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> integrates cutting-edge security technology suitable
for building firewalls and private network services in a distributed
environment.
<LI>

<STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> benefits from strong on-going development in many areas,
offering opportunities to work with emerging technologies with an
international community of programmers and end-users.
<LI>

<STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> offers opportunities for ordinary people to participate
in the development and testing of the product.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="Platforms" HREF="openbsdfaq_toc.html#Platforms">1.4  What platforms are supported?</A></H2>

<P>
Information about supported hardware platforms and peripherals
can be found on the platforms web page: <a HREF="../plat.html">
http://www.openbsd.org/plat.html</a>.

</P>
<P>
More specific information is sometimes available from the port maintainers.
Read the platforms web page first.

</P>
<P>
Support for specific platforms and peripherals often changes rapidly.
If your equipment is not supported in the latest full release, you
may find success in the current source or snapshot for your platform.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>


<H2><A NAME="Support" HREF="openbsdfaq_toc.html#Support">1.5  How can I help support <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG>?</A></H2>

<P>
We are greatly indebted to the people and organizations that have
contributed to the <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> project.  They are acknowledged
by name here: <a HREF="../donations.html">
http://www.openbsd.org/donations.html</a>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> has a constant need for several types of
support from the user community.  If you find <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> useful,
you are strongly encouraged to find a way to contribute.  If none
of the suggestions below are right for you, feel free to propose an
alternative by sending e-mail to <a HREF="mailto:donations@openbsd.org">donations@openbsd.org</a>.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Buy an <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> CD.  Includes the current full release of
<STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG>, and is bootable on many platforms.   Generates
revenue to support the <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> project, and reduces the
strain on network resources used to deliver the distribution via
the Internet.  This inexpensive two-CD set includes full source.
Remember, your friends need their own copy!
<LI>

Donate money.  The project has a constant need for cash to pay for
equipment, network connectivity, and expenses relating to CD publishing.
Manufacturing CDs requires an up-front out-of-pocket investment for
the <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> developers, without guaranteed return.  Send
e-mail to <a HREF="mailto:donations@openbsd.org">donations@openbsd.org</a> to find out how to contribute.
Even small donations make a profound difference.
<LI>

Donate equipment and parts.  The project has a constant need for
general and specific hardware.  Items such as IDE and SCSI disks,
and various types of RAM are always welcome.  For other types of
hardware such as computer systems and motherboards, you should
inquire as to current need.  Write to <a HREF="mailto:donations@openbsd.org">donations@openbsd.org</a>
to arrange for shipment.
<LI>

Donate your time and skills.  Programmers who enjoy writing operating
systems are naturally always welcome, but there are literally dozens
of other ways that people can be useful.  Follow mailing lists and
help answer new-user questions.  Help maintain documentation by submitting
new FAQ material (to <a HREF="mailto:faq@openbsd.org">faq@openbsd.org</a>).  Form a local user
group and get your friends hooked on <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG>.  Make a case
to your employer for using <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> at work.  If you're a
student, talk to your professors about using <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> as
a learning tool for Computer Science or Engineering courses.
</UL>

<P>
It's also worth mentioning one of the most important ways you
<EM>should not</EM> try to "help" the <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> project:
do not waste your time engaging in operating system flame wars
on Usenet newsgroups.  It does nothing to help the project
find new users, and it can cause substantial harm to important
relationships that <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> developers have with other
operating system developers.  The <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> team uses, learns
from, and respects many different operating systems and does
not presume to dictate what others should use.

<H2><A NAME="Manuals" HREF="openbsdfaq_toc.html#Manuals">2.3  Manual pages.</A></H2>

<P>
<STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> comes with extensive documentation in the form of manual
pages, as well as longer documents relating to specific applications.
To access the manual pages and other documentation, be sure that
you installed the <CODE>man</CODE>, <CODE>misc</CODE>, and <CODE>text</CODE> distributions.

</P>
<P>
Here is a list of some of the most useful manual pages for new users:

</P>

<PRE>
afterboot (8) - things to check after the first complete boot
passwd.conf (5) - format of the password configuration file
adduser_proc (8) - procedure for adding new users
adduser (8) - command for adding new users
vipw (8) - edit the password file
man (1) - display the on-line manual pages
sendbug (1) - send problem report (PR) about OpenBSD to a central support site
disklabel (8) - read and write disk pack label
ifconfig (8) - configure network interface parameters
route (8) - manually manipulate the routing tables.
netstat (1) - show network status
reboot, halt (8) - stopping and restarting the system
shutdown (8) - close down the system at a given time
boot_config (8) - how to change kernel configuration at boot
</PRE>

<P>
In general, if you know the name of a command or a manual page, you can
read it by executing <CODE>`man command'</CODE>.  For example: <CODE>`man vi'</CODE> to
read about the <CODE>vi</CODE> editor.  If you don't know the name of the command,
or if <CODE>`man command'</CODE> doesn't find the manual page, you can search
the manual page database by executing <CODE>`apropos something'</CODE> where
<CODE>something</CODE> is a likely word that might appear in the title of
the manual page you're looking for.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
axp# apropos "time zone"  
tzfile (5) - time zone information
zdump (8) - time zone dumper
zic (8) - time zone compiler
</PRE>

<P>
The parenthetical numbers indicate the section of the manual
in which that page can be found.  In some cases, you may find manual
pages with identical names living in separate sections of the manual.
For example, assume that you want to know the format of the configuration
files for the <CODE>cron</CODE> daemon.  Once you know the section of the
manual for the page you want, you would execute <CODE>`man n command'</CODE>
where <CODE>n</CODE> is the manual section number.

</P>

<PRE>
axp# apropos cron
cron (8) - daemon to execute scheduled commands (Vixie Cron)
crontab (1) - maintain crontab files for individual users (V3)
crontab (5) - tables for driving cron
axp# man 5 crontab
</PRE>

<P>
In addition to the UNIX manual pages, there is a typesettable
document set (included in the <CODE>misc</CODE> distribution).  It lives
in the <CODE>/usr/share/doc</CODE> directory.  If you also installed the
<CODE>text</CODE> distribution, then you can format each document set
with a <CODE>`make'</CODE> in the appropriate subdirectory.  The <CODE>psd</CODE>
subdirectory is the <STRONG>Programmer's Supplementary Documents</STRONG>
distribution.  The <CODE>smm</CODE> subdirectory is the <STRONG>System
Manager's Manual</STRONG>.  The <CODE>usd</CODE> subdirectory is the <STRONG>UNIX
User's Supplementary Documents</STRONG> distribution.  You can perform your
<CODE>`make'</CODE> in the three distribution subdirectories, or you can
select a specific section of a distribution and do a <CODE>`make'</CODE>
in its subdirectory.  Some of the subdirectories are empty.  By
default, formatting the documents will result in Postscript output,
suitable for printing.  The Postscript output can be quite large
-- you should assume 250-300% increase in volume.  If you do not
have access to a Postscript printer or display, you may also format
the documents for reading on a terminal display.  In each
<CODE>Makefile</CODE> you'll need to add the flag <CODE>-Tascii</CODE> to each
instance of the <CODE>groff</CODE> commands (or execute it by hand).
Some of the documents use the <CODE>ms</CODE> formatting macros, and some
use the <CODE>me</CODE> macros.  The <CODE>Makefile</CODE> in each document
subdirectory (eg, <CODE>/usr/share/doc/usd/04.csh/Makefile</CODE>) will
tell you which one to use.
For example:

</P>

<PRE>
axp# cd /usr/share/doc/usd/04.csh
axp# groff -Tascii -ms tabs csh.1 csh.2 csh.3 csh.4 csh.a csh.g &#62; csh.txt
axp# more csh.txt
</PRE>

<P>
The UNIX manual pages are generally more current and trustworthy than
the typesettable documents.  The typesettable documents sometimes explain
complicated applications in more detail than the manual pages do.

<H2><A NAME="GNATS" HREF="openbsdfaq_toc.html#GNATS">2.4  Reporting bugs.</A></H2>

<P>
Proper bug reporting is one of the most important responsibilities
of end users.  <STRONG>Very</STRONG> detailed information is required to diagnose
most serious bugs.  Developers frequently get bugs reports via
e-mail such as these:

</P>

<PRE>
From: joeuser@example.com
To: bugs@openbsd.org
Subject: HELP!!!

I have a PC and it won't boot!!!!!

It's a 486!!!!!
</PRE>

<P>
Hopefully most people understand why such reports get summarily deleted.
All bug reports should contain detailed information.  If Joe User had
really wanted his bug investigated, his bug report would have looked
something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
From: smartuser@example.com
To: bugs@openbsd.org
Subject: 2.2 panics on Alpha 3000/300LX

After installing OpenBSD 2.2 from the CD which I purchased via your
outstanding on-line ordering system, I find that the system panics
when trying to mount the root filesystem.  The system is a 3000/300LX
running version 7.0 firmware, with 32Mb RAM and one internal Conner
CP31370 1.3Gb SCSI disk.  The system diagnostics report no errors.
Right after it says "root on sd0a swap on sd0b" the system panics and
reboots.  Attached below is my 'dmesg' output for your edification.

Thank you.

<P>
If Joe User had a working <STRONG>OpenBSD</STRONG> system from which he wanted to
submit a bug report, he would have used the <CODE>sendbug(1)</CODE> utility
to submit his bug report to the GNATS problem tracking system.  Obviously
you can't use <CODE>sendbug(1)</CODE> when your system won't boot, but you
should use it whenever possible.  You will still need to include detailed
information about what happened, the exact configuration of your system,
and how to reproduce the problem.  The <CODE>sendbug(1)</CODE> command requires
that your system be able to deliver electronic mail successfully on
the Internet.

If you have submitted a bug report and you want to check its current
status without annoying anyone, the best ways are:
