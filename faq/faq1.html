<h2>1.1 - What is OpenBSD?</h2>

<p>
The <a href="../index.html">OpenBSD</a> project produces a freely
available, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system. Our
<a href="../goals.html">goals</a> place emphasis on correctness, 
<a href="../security.html">security</a>, standardization, and
<a href="../plat.html">portability</a>. 
OpenBSD supports binary emulation of most
binaries from SVR4 (Solaris), FreeBSD, Linux, BSDI, SunOS, and HPUX.

<!-- XXXrelease -->
<p>
This FAQ specifically covers only the most recent release of
OpenBSD, version 3.3.

<p>
<a name="Platforms"></a>
<h2>1.2 - On what systems does OpenBSD run?</h2>
<!-- XXXrelease -->
<p>
OpenBSD 3.3 runs on the following platforms:
<ul>
    <li><a href="../i386.html">i386</a> - CD bootable
    <li><a href="../sparc.html">sparc</a> - CD bootable
    <li><a href="../sparc64.html">sparc64</a> - CD bootable
    <li><a href="../hp300.html">hp300</a> - FTP only 
    <li><a href="../mac68k.html">mac68k</a> - FTP only
    <li><a href="../macppc.html">macppc</a> - CD bootable
    <li><a href="../mvme68k.html">mvme68k</a> - FTP only
    <li><a href="../alpha.html">alpha</a> - FTP only 
    <li><a href="../vax.html">vax</a>
    <li><a href="../hppa.html">hppa</a> - FTP only <i>* New for 3.3 *</i>
</ul>

<p>
<i>bootable</i> means that OpenBSD will boot directly from the CD.  The
CD set will boot on several hardware platforms.
See <a href="faq3.html">chapter 3</a> of this FAQ for details of
obtaining OpenBSD on CD.

<p>
Previous releases of OpenBSD also had a port for:
<ul>
  <li><a href="../amiga.html">amiga</a> - removed after the 3.2 release
  <li><a href="../sun3.html">sun3</a> - removed after the 2.9 release
  <li><a href="../arc.html">arc</a> - removed after the 2.3 release
  <li><a href="../mvme88k.html">mvme88k</a>
  <li><a href="../pmax.html">pmax</a> - removed after the 2.7 release
</ul>

<p>
OpenBSD does not currently support more than one processor.
See <a href="faq8.html#SMP">FAQ 8, SMP</a> for more info.

<p>
<a name="ReallyFree"></a>
<h2>1.3 - Is OpenBSD really free?</h2>

<p>
OpenBSD is all free. The binaries are free. The source is free. All
parts of OpenBSD have reasonable copyright terms permitting free
redistribution.  This includes the ability to REUSE most parts of the
OpenBSD source tree, either for personal or commercial purposes. OpenBSD
includes NO further restrictions other than those implied by the
original BSD license.  Software which is written under stricter licenses
cannot be included in the regular distribution of OpenBSD.  This is
intended to safeguard the free use of OpenBSD.  For example, OpenBSD can
be freely used for personal use, for academic use, by government
institutions, by non-profit making organizations and by commercial
organizations.

<p>
For further reading on other popular licenses read: 
<a href="../policy.html">http://www.openbsd.org/policy.html</a>.

<p>
The maintainers of OpenBSD support the project largely from their own
pockets.  This includes the time spent programming for the project,
equipment used to support the many ports, the network resources used to
distribute OpenBSD to you, and the time spent answering questions and
investigating users' bug reports.  The OpenBSD developers are not
independently wealthy and even small contributions of time, equipment,
and resources make a big difference.


<p>
<a name="WhyUse"></a>
<h2>1.4 - Why might I want to use OpenBSD?</h2>

<p>
New users frequently want to know whether OpenBSD is superior to some
other free UNIX-like operating system. That question is largely
unanswerable and is the subject of countless (and useless) religious
debates. Do not, under any circumstances, ask such a question on an
OpenBSD mailing list. 

<p>
Below are some reasons why we think OpenBSD is a useful operating
system.  Whether OpenBSD is right for you is a question that only you
can answer. 

<p>
<ul>
   <li>OpenBSD runs on many <a href="../plat.html">different hardware
   platforms</a>.
   <li>OpenBSD is thought of by many security professionals to be the
   most <a href="../security.html">secure</a> UNIX-like operating system
   as the result of a 10-member 1.5-year long comprehensive source code
   security audit.
   <li>OpenBSD is a full-featured UNIX-like operating system available
   in source form at no charge.
   <li>OpenBSD integrates cutting-edge security technology suitable for
   building firewalls and <a href="../crypto.html#hardware">private
   network services</a> in a distributed environment.
   <li>OpenBSD benefits from strong ongoing development in many areas,
   offering opportunities to work with emerging technologies with an
   international community of programmers and end-users.
   <li>OpenBSD offers opportunities for ordinary people to participate
   in the development and testing of the product.
</ul>

<p>
<a name="Support"></a>
<h2>1.5 - How can I help support OpenBSD?</h2>

<p>
We are greatly indebted to the people and organizations that have
contributed to the OpenBSD project. They are acknowledged by name
on the <a href="../donations.html">donations page</a>.

<p>
OpenBSD has a constant need for several types of support from the user
community. If you find OpenBSD useful, you are strongly encouraged to
find a way to contribute. If none of the suggestions below are right for
you, feel free to propose an alternative by sending e-mail to 
<a href="mailto:donations@openbsd.org">donations@openbsd.org</a>. 

<p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="../orders.html">Buy an OpenBSD CD set</a>. It includes
    the current full release of OpenBSD, and is bootable on many
    platforms. It also generates revenue to support the OpenBSD project,
    and reduces the strain on network resources used to deliver the
    distribution via the Internet. This inexpensive three-CD set
    includes full source. Remember, your friends need their own copy!
    <li><a href="../donations.html">Donate money</a>. The project has a
    constant need for cash to pay for equipment, network connectivity,
    and expenses relating to CD publishing.  Manufacturing CDs requires
    an up-front out-of-pocket investment for the OpenBSD developers,
    without guaranteed return. Send e-mail to
    <a href="mailto:donations@openbsd.org">donations@openbsd.org</a> to
    find out how to contribute. Even small donations make a profound
    difference.
    <li><a href="../want.html">Donate equipment and parts</a>. The
    project has a constant need for general and specific hardware. Items
    such as IDE and SCSI disks, and various types of RAM are always
    welcome. For other types of hardware such as computer systems and
    motherboards, you should inquire as to current need. Write to
    <a href="mailto:donations@openbsd.org">donations@openbsd.org</a> to
    arrange for shipment.
    <li>Donate your time and skills. Programmers who enjoy writing
    operating systems are naturally always welcome, but there are
    literally dozens of other ways that people can be useful. Follow
    <a href="../mail.html">mailing</a> lists and help answer new-user
    questions.
    <li>Help maintain documentation by submitting new FAQ material (to
    <a href="mailto:faq@openbsd.org">faq@openbsd.org</a>). Form a local
    <a href="../groups.html">user group</a> and get your friends hooked
    on OpenBSD. Make a case to your employer for using OpenBSD at work.
    If you're a student, talk to your professors about using OpenBSD as
    a learning tool for Computer Science or Engineering courses. It's
    also worth mentioning one of the most important ways you should not
    try to "help" the OpenBSD project: do not waste your time engaging
    in operating system flame wars. It does not help the project to find
    new users and can cause substantial harm to important relationships
    that developers have with other developers.
</ul>


<p>
<a name="WhoMaintains"></a>
<h2>1.6 - Who maintains OpenBSD?</h2>

<p>
OpenBSD is maintained by a development team spread across many different
<a href="../images/map.jpg">countries</a>. The project is coordinated by
Theo de Raadt, located in Canada.

<p>
<a name="Next"></a>
<h2>1.7 - When is the next release of OpenBSD?</h2>

The OpenBSD team makes a new release every six months, with target release
dates of May 1 and November 1.  More information on the development cycle 
can be found <a href="faq5.html#Flavors">here</a>.

<a name="Included"></a>
<h2>1.8 - What is included with OpenBSD?</h2>
OpenBSD is distributed with a number of third-party software products,
including:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.xfree.org">XFree86 4.2.1</a> the X Window
environment.  For i386, v3.3 X servers are also included for additional
graphic chipset support.  Installed with the <tt>x*.tgz</tt>
<a href="faq4.html#FilesNeeded">install file sets</a>.

<li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC 2.95</a> GNU C Compiler.  The
OpenBSD team has added the
<a href="http://www.trl.ibm.com/projects/security/ssp">Propolice</a>
stack protection technology, enabled by default, and used throughout the
OpenBSD userland and by default on applications compiled on OpenBSD.  
Installed as part of the <tt>comp33.tgz</tt>
<a href="faq4.html#FilesNeeded">file set</a>.

<li><a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl 5.8.0</a>, with patches and
improvements from the OpenBSD team.

<li><a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache 1.3.27</a> web server. The
OpenBSD team has added <a href="faq10.html#httpdchroot">default
chrooting</a>, privilege revocation, and other security-related
improvements.  Also includes mod_ssl 2.8 and DSO support.

<li><a href="http://www.openssl.org">OpenSSL 0.9.7beta3</a>, with patches
and improvements from the OpenBSD team.

<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/groff/groff.html">Groff 1.15</a>
text processor.

<li><a href="http://www.sendmail.org/">Sendmail 8.12.9</a> mail
server.

<li><a href="http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/">BIND 9.2.2</a> DNS
server.  OpenBSD has implemented many improvements in chroot operation
and other security-related issues.

<li><a href="http://lynx.isc.org/">Lynx 2.8.2rel.1</a> text web browser.
With HTTPS support added, plus patches from the OpenBSD team.

<li><a href="http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/">Sudo v1.6.7</a>, allowing 
users to run individual commands as root.

<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html">Ncurses
5.2.</a>

<li><a href="http://www.kame.net/">KAME</a> IPv6.

<li>KTH Kerberos 1.1.1.

<li>Heimdal 0.4e with patches

<li><a href="http://www.openssh.com">OpenSSH 3.6</a>

</ul>

As can be seen, the OpenBSD team often patches third-party products
(typically) to improve the security or quality of the code.  In
some cases, the user will see no difference in operation, in other
cases, there ARE operational differences which may impact some users.
Keep these enhancements in mind before blindly adding different versions
of the same software.

<p>
Of course, additional applications can be added through the OpenBSD 
<a href="faq8.html#Packages">packages</a> and 
<a href="faq8.html#Ports">ports</a> system.
