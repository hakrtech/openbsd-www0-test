<h1> 1.0 - Introduction to OpenBSD </h1>

<h2>1.1 - What is OpenBSD?</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> project produces a freely available, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system. Our efforts
place emphasis on portability, standardization, correctness, and security. <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> supports binary emulation of most
binaries from SVR4 (Solaris), FreeBSD, Linux, BSDI, SunOS, and HPUX.<br>
<p>
<a name="1.2"></a>
<h2>1.2 - On what systems does OpenBSD run?</h2>
<p>
OpenBSD 2.4 will install and run on the following platforms: <br>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/i386.html">i386</a> - bootable
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/sparc.html">sparc</a> - bootable
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/alpha.html">alpha</a> - bootable
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/hp300.html">hp300</a>
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/amiga.html">amiga</a>
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/mac68k.html">mac68k</a>
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/powerpc.html">powerpc</a>
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/pmax.html">pmax</a>
<ul>
<li>pmax port is not included on the 2.4 cd. But can be downloaded from any of the OpenBSD ftp sites
</ul>
</ul>
 * note * - bootable means that for those smart people who bought the cd, that it OpenBSD can be booted directly from the CD.
<p>
Previous releases of OpenBSD also had ports for:<br>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/arc.html">arc</a>, <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/mvme68k.html">mvme68k</a>
<br>
<p>
These were removed from the 2.4 release, but are on 2.3 if you are interested. You can see updated information about specific
platforms at <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/plat.html">www.openbsd.org/plat.html</a><br>

<h2>1.3 - Is OpenBSD really free? </h2>
<p>
OpenBSD is all free. The binaries are free. The source is free. All parts of OpenBSD have reasonable copyright terms
permitting free redistribution.
<p>
More about copyright policy: <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/policy.html">http://www.openbsd.org/policy.html</a>.<br>
<p>
The maintainers of OpenBSD support the project largely from their own pockets. This includes the time spent programming for
the project, equipment used to support the many ports, the network resources used to distribute OpenBSD to you, and the
time spent answering questions and investigating users' bug reports. The OpenBSD developers are not independently wealthy
and even small contributions of time, equipment, and resources make a big difference.

<h2> 1.4 - Why might I want to use OpenBSD? </h2>
<p>
New users frequently want to know whether OpenBSD is superior to some other free UNIX-like operating system. That
question is largely un-answerable and is the subject of countless (and useless) religious debates. Do not, under any
circumstances, ask such a question on an OpenBSD mailing list. 
<p>
Below are some reasons why we think OpenBSD is a useful operating system. Whether OpenBSD is right for you is a question
that only you can answer. <br>
<ul>
<li>OpenBSD runs on many different hardware platforms. 
<li>OpenBSD is thought by many security professionals to be the most secure UNIX-like operating system as the result of a
     10-member 1.5-year long comprehensive source code security audit. 
<li>OpenBSD is a full-featured UNIX-like operating system available in source form at no charge. 
<li>OpenBSD integrates cutting-edge security technology suitable for building firewalls and private network services in a
     distributed environment. 
<li>OpenBSD benefits from strong on-going development in many areas, offering opportunities to work with emerging
     technologies with an international community of programmers and end-users. <li>OpenBSD offers opportunities for ordinary people to participate in the development and testing of the product. 
</ul>

<h2>1.5 - How can I help support OpenBSD?</h2>
<p>
We are greatly indebted to the people and organizations that have contributed to the OpenBSD project. They are
acknowledged by name here:<br>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/donations.html">www.openbsd.org/donations.html</a>
<p>
OpenBSD has a constant need for several types of support from the user community. If you find OpenBSD useful, you are
strongly encouraged to find a way to contribute. If none of the suggestions below are right for you, feel free to propose an
alternative by sending e-mail to <a href="mailto:donations@openbsd.org">donations@openbsd.org.</a> 
<p>
<ul>
<li>Buy an OpenBSD CD. Includes the current full release of OpenBSD, and is bootable on many platforms. Generates
     revenue to support the OpenBSD project, and reduces the strain on network resources used to deliver the distribution
     via the Internet. This inexpensive two-CD set includes full source. Remember, your friends need their own copy! 
<li>Donate money. The project has a constant need for cash to pay for equipment, network connectivity, and expenses
     relating to CD publishing. Manufacturing CDs requires an up-front out-of-pocket investment for the OpenBSD
     developers, without guaranteed return. Send e-mail to <a href="mailto:donations@openbsd.org">donations@openbsd.org</a> to find out how to contribute. Even small
     donations make a profound difference. 
<li>Donate equipment and parts. The project has a constant need for general and specific hardware. Items such as IDE and
     SCSI disks, and various types of RAM are always welcome. For other types of hardware such as computer systems
     and motherboards, you should inquire as to current need. Write to <a href="mailto:donations@openbsd.org">donations@openbsd.org</a> to arrange for shipment. 
<li>Donate your time and skills. Programmers who enjoy writing operating systems are naturally always welcome, but there
     are literally dozens of other ways that people can be useful. Follow mailing lists and help answer new-user questions. 
<li>Help maintain documentation by submitting new FAQ material (to <a href="mailto:faq@openbsd.org">faq@openbsd.org</a>). Form a local user group and get
     your friends hooked on OpenBSD. Make a case to your employer for using OpenBSD at work. If you're a student, talk
     to your professors about using OpenBSD as a learning tool for Computer Science or Engineering courses. It's also
     worth mentioning one of the most important ways you should not try to "help" The OpenBSD project: do not waste your
     time engaging in operating system flame wars on Usenet newsgroups. it does nothing to help project find new users and
     can cause substantial harm important relationships that developers have with other developers. team uses learns from
     respects many different systems presume dictate what others should use
</ul>
<p>
<h2>1.6 - Who maintains OpenBSD?</h2>
<a name="1.6"></a>
<p>
OpenBSD is maintained by a development team spread across many different countries. The project is coordinated by Theo de
Raadt, located in Canada.
