<h2>1.1 - What is OpenBSD?</h2>

<p>
The <a href="../index.html">OpenBSD</a> project produces a freely
available, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system. Our
<a href="../goals.html">goals</a> place emphasis on correctness, 
<a href="../security.html">security</a>, standardization, and
<a href="../plat.html">portability</a>. 
OpenBSD supports binary emulation of most
binaries from SVR4 (Solaris), FreeBSD, Linux, BSDI, SunOS, and HPUX.

<!-- XXXrelease -->
<p>
This FAQ specifically covers only the most recent release of
OpenBSD, version 4.1.

<p>
<a name="Platforms"></a>
<h2>1.2 - On what systems does OpenBSD run?</h2>
<!-- XXXrelease -->
<p>
OpenBSD 4.1 runs on the following platforms:
<ul>
    <li><a href="../alpha.html">alpha</a> - FTP only
    <li><a href="../amd64.html">amd64</a> - CD bootable

    <li><a href="../vax.html">vax</a> - FTP only
    <li><a href="../zaurus.html">zaurus</a> - FTP only
</ul>

<p>
<i>CD bootable</i> means that OpenBSD will boot directly from the CD.  The
CD set will boot on several hardware platforms.
See <a href="faq3.html">chapter 3</a> of this FAQ for details of
obtaining OpenBSD on CD.

<p>
More information on OpenBSD platforms can be found on the 
<a href="../plat.html">Platforms</a> page.

<p>
People sometimes ask why we support so many "odd" machines.
The short answer is, "because we want to".
If enough skilled people (sometimes, "enough" is only one really skilled
person!) wish to maintain support for a platform, it will be
supported.
There are practical benefits to keeping OpenBSD multi-platform: when new
platforms come out, the code tree is relatively free of
portability-breaking bugs and design flaws.
The OpenBSD platforms include 32 bit and 64 bit processors, little and
big endian machines, and many different designs.
And yes, supporting "unusual" platforms has helped produced a
higher-quality code base for more "common" platforms.

<a name="ReallyFree"></a>
<h2>1.3 - Is OpenBSD really free?</h2>

<p>
OpenBSD is all free. The binaries are free. The source is free. All
parts of OpenBSD have reasonable copyright terms permitting free
redistribution.  This includes the ability to REUSE most parts of the
OpenBSD source tree, either for personal or commercial purposes. OpenBSD
includes NO further restrictions other than those implied by the
original BSD license.  Software which is written under stricter licenses
cannot be included in the regular distribution of OpenBSD.  This is
intended to safeguard the free use of OpenBSD.  For example, OpenBSD can
be freely used for personal use, for academic use, by government
institutions, by non-profit making organizations and by commercial
organizations.
OpenBSD, or parts of it, can also be freely incorporated into
<a href="../products.html">commercial products</a>.

<p>
People sometimes ask if it bothers us that our free work is put into
commercial products.
The answer is, we would prefer that our good code be <i>widely used</i>
than that commercial software vendors reimplement and create badly coded
incompatible alternative solutions to already solved problems.
For example, it is likely that SSH is a widely used protocol due to
this freedom, much more widely used than if restrictions had been placed
on how people used the OpenSSH code.

<p>
This isn't to say we would object to <a href="../donations.html">financial
or hardware support</a> in thanks.
In fact, it is stunning how little support of any kind comes from
companies that depend upon OpenBSD for their products, but there is no
requirement of compensation.

<p>
For further reading on other popular licenses read: 
<a href="../policy.html">OpenBSD Copyright Policy</a>.

<p>
The maintainers of OpenBSD support the project largely from their own
pockets.  This includes the time spent programming for the project,
equipment used to support the many ports, the network resources used to
distribute OpenBSD to you, and the time spent answering questions and
investigating users' bug reports.  The OpenBSD developers are not
independently wealthy and even small contributions of time, equipment,
and resources make a big difference.


<p>
<a name="WhyUse"></a>
<h2>1.4 - Why might I want to use OpenBSD?</h2>

<p>
New users frequently want to know whether OpenBSD is superior to some
other free UNIX-like operating system. That question is largely
unanswerable and is the subject of countless (and useless) religious
debates. Do not, under any circumstances, ask such a question on an
OpenBSD mailing list. 

<p>
Below are some reasons why we think OpenBSD is a useful operating
system.  Whether OpenBSD is right for you is a question that only you
can answer. 

<p>
<ul>
   <li>OpenBSD runs on many <a href="../plat.html">different hardware
   platforms</a>.
   <li>OpenBSD is thought of by many security professionals as the
   most <a href="../security.html">secure</a> UNIX-like operating system,
   as the result of a never-ending comprehensive source code
   security audit.
   <li>OpenBSD is a full-featured UNIX-like operating system available
   in source form at no charge.
   <li>OpenBSD integrates cutting-edge security technology suitable for
   building firewalls and <a href="../crypto.html#hardware">private
   network services</a> in a distributed environment.
   <li>OpenBSD benefits from strong ongoing development in many areas,
   offering opportunities to work with emerging technologies with an
   international community of programmers and end-users.
   <li>OpenBSD attempts to minimize the need for customization and 
   tweaking.
   For the vast majority of users, OpenBSD "Just Works" on their
   hardware for their application.
   Not only is tweaking and customizing rarely needed, it is actively
   <a href="faq5.html#Why">discouraged</a>.
</ul>

<p>
<a name="Support"></a>
<h2>1.5 - How can I help support OpenBSD?</h2>

<p>
We are greatly indebted to the people and organizations that have
contributed to the OpenBSD project. They are acknowledged by name
on the <a href="../donations.html">donations page</a>.

<p>
OpenBSD has a constant need for several types of support from the user
community. If you find OpenBSD useful, you are strongly encouraged to
find a way to contribute. If none of the suggestions below are right for
you, feel free to propose an alternative by sending e-mail to 
<a href="mailto:donations@openbsd.org">donations@openbsd.org</a>. 

<p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="../orders.html">Buy an OpenBSD CD set</a>. It includes
    the current full release of OpenBSD, and is bootable on many
    platforms. It also generates revenue to support the OpenBSD project,
    and reduces the strain on network resources used to deliver the
    distribution via the Internet. This inexpensive three-CD set
    includes full source. Remember, your friends need their own copy!
    <li><a href="../donations.html">Donate money</a>. The project has a
    constant need for cash to pay for equipment, network connectivity,
    and expenses relating to CD publishing.  Manufacturing CDs requires
    an up-front out-of-pocket investment for the OpenBSD developers,
    without guaranteed return. Send e-mail to
    <a href="mailto:donations@openbsd.org">donations@openbsd.org</a> to
    find out how to contribute. Even small donations make a profound
    difference.
    <li><a href="../want.html">Donate equipment and parts</a>. The
    project has a constant need for general and specific hardware. Items
    such as IDE and SCSI disks, and various types of RAM are always
    welcome. For other types of hardware such as computer systems and
    motherboards, you should inquire as to current need. Write to
    <a href="mailto:donations@openbsd.org">donations@openbsd.org</a> to
    arrange for shipment.
    <li>Donate your time and skills. Programmers who enjoy writing
    operating systems are naturally always welcome, but there are
    literally dozens of other ways that people can be useful. Follow
    <a href="../mail.html">mailing</a> lists and help answer new-user
    questions.
    <li>Help maintain documentation by submitting new FAQ material (to
    <a href="mailto:faq@openbsd.org">faq@openbsd.org</a>). Form a local
    <a href="../groups.html">user group</a> and get your friends hooked
    on OpenBSD. Make a case to your employer for using OpenBSD at work.
    If you're a student, talk to your professors about using OpenBSD as
    a learning tool for Computer Science or Engineering courses. It's
    also worth mentioning one of the most important ways you should not
    try to "help" the OpenBSD project: do not waste your time engaging
    in operating system flame wars. It does not help the project to find
    new users and can cause substantial harm to important relationships
    that developers have with other developers.
</ul>


<p>
<a name="WhoMaintains"></a>
<h2>1.6 - Who maintains OpenBSD?</h2>

<p>
OpenBSD is maintained by a development team spread across many different
<a href="../images/map.jpg">countries</a>. The project is coordinated by
Theo de Raadt, located in Canada.

<p>
<a name="Next"></a>
<h2>1.7 - When is the next release of OpenBSD?</h2>

The OpenBSD team makes a new release every six months, with target release
dates in May and November.  More information on the development cycle 
can be found <a href="faq5.html#Flavors">here</a>.

<a name="Included"></a>
<h2>1.8 - What is included with OpenBSD?</h2>
OpenBSD is distributed with a number of third-party software products,
including:
<!-- XXXrelease -->

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.x.org">X.org 6.9.0</a>,
the X Window environment, with local patches.

users to run individual commands as root.

<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html">Ncurses
5.2</a>

<li><a href="http://www.kame.net/">KAME</a> IPv6

<li><a href="http://www.pdc.kth.se/heimdal/">Heimdal 0.7.2</a> with patches

<li><a href="http://www.stacken.kth.se/projekt/arla/">Arla 0.35.7</a>

<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/">Binutils 2.15</a> 
with patches

Network Time Protocol implementation 

<li><a href="http://www.openbgpd.org/">OpenBGPD and OpenOSPFD 4.1</a>
routing applications

</ul>

As can be seen, the OpenBSD team often patches third-party products
(typically) to improve the security or quality of the code.  In
some cases, the user will see no difference in operation, in other
cases, there ARE operational differences which may impact some users.
Keep these enhancements in mind before blindly adding different versions
of the same software.
You may get a bigger version number, but a less secure system.

<p>
Of course, additional applications can be added through the OpenBSD 
<a href="faq15.html">packages and ports</a> system. 
<p>

<a name="WhatsNew"></a>
<h2>1.9 - What is new in OpenBSD 4.1?</h2>
<!-- XXXrelease -->

The complete list of changes made to OpenBSD 4.0 to create OpenBSD 4.1
can be found on <a href="../plus41.html">plus41.html</a>, and highlights
on the <a href="../41.html">OpenBSD 4.1 Information page</a>, however
here are a few changes the OpenBSD team anticipate will require or
warrant some special note to people upgrading or installing OpenBSD 4.1
who are familiar with older versions:

<ul>
<li><b>OpenBSD/sparc64</b><br>
UltraSPARC III-based systems are now supported much better, including
running at full speed.

<p>
<li><b>"flags S/SA keep state" implicit in pf.conf(5)</b><br>
<i>flags S/SA keep state</i> is now the default for pass rules in
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf.conf&amp;sektion=5">pf.conf(5)</a>,
and new <i>no state</i> and <i>flags any</i> options have been added to
override these defaults.
Current rulesets will continue to load, but the behaviour may be
slightly changed as these defaults are more restrictive.
Rulesets with stateless filtering (<i>no state</i>) or a requirement to
create states on intermediate packets (<i>flags any</i>) should be
updated to explicitly request the desired behaviour.

<p>
In particular care should be taken with the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=enc&amp;sektion=4">enc0</a>
interface, as floating states are a potential problem for filtering IPsec
traffic: states need to be interface bound, to avoid permitting unencrypted
traffic should
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=isakmpd&amp;sektion=8">isakmpd(8)</a>
exit. Therefore all rules on the enc0 interface should explicitly set
<i>keep state (if-bound)</i>.

<p>
<li><b>FreeBSD and NetBSD DOS MBR partitions are no longer used to store
disklabels, and are no longer searched for a disklabel</b><br>
As a result, disks with only FreeBSD or NetBSD DOS MBR partitions will
no longer have an 'a' partition created in the spoofed disklabel.
The disklabel on such disks will be stored and loaded from sector 1, and
this could find an old accidental disklabel.
Use fdisk(8) to change the partition type to OpenBSD ('A6') to use the
existing disklabel.

<p>
<li><b>amd64, i386, macppc, and mvmeppc no longer try to boot from the first
NetBSD partition when no OpenBSD partition is found.</b><br>

Again, use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&amp;sektion=8">fdisk(8)</a>
to change the partition type to OpenBSD ('A6').

<p>
<li><b>New way to enable/disable system accounting on boot</b><br>
In order to enable accounting on boot you need to set the new rc.conf
variable "accounting=YES".
The presence of the /var/account/acct file does not make it start
automatically anymore.

<p>
<li><b>spamd(8):<br>
</b> spamd.conf(5) is now stored in /etc/mail.
Move your spamd.conf file into <tt>/etc/mail</tt> so that spamd(8) loads
the proper configuration.<br>

<p>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=spamd&amp;sektion=8">spamd(8)</a>
and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=spamd&amp;sektion=8">spamdlog(8)</a>
now support synchronisation of the greylist database across multiple
hosts.
The greytrapping mechanism now allows for whole domain traps, and
noticing out of order MX use.

<p>
spamd(8) now runs in greylist mode by default:
Whereas before greylisting had to be enabled via the <tt>-g</tt> flag,
it is now the default runtime mode.
The <tt>-b</tt> flag (which used to indicate which IP spamd(8) should
listen on) can be used to run spamd in blacklist-only mode.
The new <tt>-l</tt> flag is used to indicate which IP spamd should
listen on.

<p>
<li><b>Kernel sensors sysctl(3) MIB is now hierarchical</b><br>
The sensors sysctl(3) MIB now contains the name of the sensor device as
well as the type and index of the actual sensor.
So before when running "sysctl hw.sensors" you might've seen
"<tt>hw.sensors.12=it0, Temp 1, 25.00 degC</tt>" you will now see
"<tt>hw.sensors.it0.temp0=25.00 degC</tt>".
Update your
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sensorsd.conf&amp;sektion=5"
>sensorsd.conf(5)</a> file to reflect the new names of your sensors.
</ul>


<a name="Desktop"></a>
<h2>1.10 - Can I use OpenBSD as a desktop system?</h2>
This question is often asked in exactly this manner -- with no
explanation of what the asker means by "desktop".
The only person who can answer that question is you, as it depends on
what your needs and expectations are.

<p>
While OpenBSD has a great reputation as a "server" operating system, it
can be and is used on the desktop.
Many "desktop" applications are available through
<a href="faq15.html">packages and ports</a>.
As with all operating system decisions, the question is: can it do the
job you desire in the way you wish?
You must answer this question for yourself.

<p>
It might be worth noting that a large amount of OpenBSD development is
done on laptops.


<a name="HowAbout"></a>
<h2>1.11 - Why is/isn't <i>ProductX</i> included?</h2>

People often ask why a particular product is or isn't included with
OpenBSD.
The answer is based on two things: the wishes of the developers and
compatibility with the <a href="../policy.html">goals</a> of the
project.
A product will not be included simply because it is "neat" -- it must
also be "free" for use, distribution and modification by our standards.
A product must also be stable and secure -- a bigger version number does
not always mean a better product.

<p>
License is often the biggest problem: we want OpenBSD to remain usable
by any person anywhere in the world for any purpose.

<p>
Another major consideration is the wishes of the developers.
The OpenBSD developers are the ultimate judges of what does and doesn't
go into the project.
Just because an application is "good" doesn't mean the OpenBSD project
wishes to devote the resources needed to maintaining it, or that 
they will share other's enthusiasm about its place in OpenBSD.

<p>
Some commonly asked questions about third-party products:
<ul>
<li><i>Why is Sendmail included, it is "known insecure"?!</i><br>
Sendmail has
had an imperfect security record, however the Sendmail authors and
maintainers have been very receptive to reworking their code to make it
much more secure (and this is a sadly uncommon response).
The recent security history of Sendmail is not much different than some
of the supposedly "more secure" alternatives.

<li><i>Why isn't Postfix included?</i><br>
The license is not free, and thus
can not be considered.

<li><i>Why isn't qmail or djbdns included?</i><br>
License, or lack of: the
inability to distribute a modified version of this software keeps it
from being considered.

<li><i>Why is Apache included? It isn't needed by many people!</i><br> 
Because the developers want it.

<li><i>Why isn't a newer version of Apache included?</i><br>
The license on
newer versions is unacceptable.

<li><i>Why isn't bzip2 included instead of gzip?</i><br>
Performance is horrible, and benefit is minimal.
Impact on slower platforms, such as m68k or VAX would be unacceptable.

</ul>

In most cases, these topics have been discussed in painful detail on
the <a href="faq2.html#MailLists">mail lists</a>, please see archives
if you need more information.

<p>
Of course, If you wish to use one of these packages and your use is
compatible with the license of the products, no one will stop you (that
wouldn't be very free if we tried, would it?).
However, your needs may change -- you may not want to develop a
"Killer Application" that you can't sell, distribute, or get rich from
because you incorporated non-free software into it.
