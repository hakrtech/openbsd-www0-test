<h1>1.0 - Introduction to OpenBSD</h1>
<hr>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<a name= "1.1"></a>
<h2>1.1 - What is OpenBSD?</h2>
</p>

<p>
The <a href= "http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> project produces a freely 
available, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system. Our efforts
place emphasis on portability, standardization, correctness, and security.
<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> supports binary emulation of most
binaries from SVR4 (Solaris), FreeBSD, Linux, BSDI, SunOS, and HPUX.<br>
</p>

<br>

<h2>1.2 - On what systems does OpenBSD run?</h2>
</p>

<p>
OpenBSD 2.4 will install and run on the following platforms:
<ul>
    <li><a href= "../i386.html">i386</a> - bootable</li>
    <li><a href= "../sparc.html">sparc</a> - bootable</li>
    <li><a href= "../alpha.html">alpha</a> - bootable</li>
    <li><a href= "../hp300.html">hp300</a></li>
    <li><a href= "../amiga.html">amiga</a></li>
    <li><a href= "../mac68k.html">mac68k</a></li>
    <li><a href= "../powerpc.html">powerpc</a></li>
    <li><a href= "../pmax.html">pmax</a></li>
        <ul>
        <li>the pmax port is not included on the 2.4 cd. But can be downloaded
            from any of the OpenBSD ftp sites</li>
        </ul>
</ul>
* note * - bootable means that for those smart people who bought the cd, that 
           it OpenBSD can be booted directly from the CD.
</p>

<p>
Previous releases of OpenBSD also had ports for:
<ul>
    <li><a href= "../arc.html">arc</a></li>
    <li><a href= "../mvme68k.html">mvme68k</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
These were removed from the 2.4 release, but were included in 2.3 if you
are interested. You can see updated information about specific
platforms at <a href= "../plat.html">http://www.openbsd.org/plat.html</a><br>
</p>

<h2>1.3 - Is OpenBSD really free?</h2>
</p>

<p>
OpenBSD is all free. The binaries are free. The source is free. All parts of 
OpenBSD have reasonable copyright terms permitting free redistribution.
</p>

<p>
More about copyright policy: 
<a href= "../policy.html">http://www.openbsd.org/policy.html</a>.
</p>

<p>
The maintainers of OpenBSD support the project largely from their own pockets. 
This includes the time spent programming for the project, equipment used to 
support the many ports, the network resources used to distribute OpenBSD to you,
and the time spent answering questions and investigating users' bug reports. 
The OpenBSD developers are not independently wealthy and even small
contributions of time, equipment, and resources make a big difference.
</p>

<h2>1.4 - Why might I want to use OpenBSD?</h2>
</p>

<p>
New users frequently want to know whether OpenBSD is superior to some other 
free UNIX-like operating system. That question is largely un-answerable and is 
the subject of countless (and useless) religious debates. Do not, under any
circumstances, ask such a question on an OpenBSD mailing list. 
</p>

<p>
Below are some reasons why we think OpenBSD is a useful operating system. 
Whether OpenBSD is right for you is a question that only you can answer. 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
    <li>OpenBSD runs on many different hardware platforms.</li> 
    <li>OpenBSD is thought of by many security professionals to be the most
        secure UNIX-like operating system as the result of a 10-member 1.5-year
        long comprehensive source code security audit.</li> 
    <li>OpenBSD is a full-featured UNIX-like operating system available in
        source form at no charge.</li> 
    <li>OpenBSD integrates cutting-edge security technology suitable for
        building firewalls and private network services in a distributed 
        environment.</li> 
    <li>OpenBSD benefits from strong on-going development in many areas, 
        offering opportunities to work with emerging technologies with an 
        international community of programmers and end-users.</li>
    <li>OpenBSD offers opportunities for ordinary people to participate in the 
        development and testing of the product.</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<h2>1.5 - How can I help support OpenBSD?</h2>
</p>

<p>
We are greatly indebted to the people and organizations that have contributed
to the OpenBSD project. They are acknowledged by name here:
</p>

<p>
<a href= "../donations.html">http://www.openbsd.org/donations.html</a>
</p>

<p>
OpenBSD has a constant need for several types of support from the user 
community. If you find OpenBSD useful, you are strongly encouraged to find a 
way to contribute. If none of the suggestions below are right for you, feel 
free to propose an alternative by sending e-mail to 
<a href= "mailto:donations@openbsd.org">donations@openbsd.org.</a> 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
    <li>Buy an OpenBSD CD. It includes the current full release of OpenBSD,
        and is bootable on many platforms. It also generates revenue to support
        the OpenBSD project, and reduces the strain on network resources used
        to deliver the distribution via the Internet. This inexpensive two-CD
        set includes full source. Remember, your friends need their own
        copy!</li> 
    <li>Donate money. The project has a constant need for cash to pay for
        equipment, network connectivity, and expenses relating to CD publishing.
        Manufacturing CDs requires an up-front out-of-pocket investment for the
        OpenBSD developers, without guaranteed return. Send e-mail to 
        <a href= "mailto:donations@openbsd.org">donations@openbsd.org</a>
        to find out how to contribute. Even small donations make a profound
        difference.</li> 
    <li>Donate equipment and parts. The project has a constant need for general
        and specific hardware. Items such as IDE and SCSI disks, and various
        types of RAM are always welcome. For other types of hardware such as
        computer systems and motherboards, you should inquire as to current
        need. Write to 
        <a href= "mailto:donations@openbsd.org">donations@openbsd.org</a>
        to arrange for shipment.</li> 
    <li>Donate your time and skills. Programmers who enjoy writing operating
        systems are naturally always welcome, but there are literally dozens of
        other ways that people can be useful. Follow mailing lists and help 
        answer new-user questions.</li> 
    <li>Help maintain documentation by submitting new FAQ material (to 
        <a href= "mailto:faq@openbsd.org">faq@openbsd.org</a>). Form a local
        user group and get your friends hooked on OpenBSD. Make a case to your
        employer for using OpenBSD at work. If you're a student, talk
        to your professors about using OpenBSD as a learning tool for Computer
        Science or Engineering courses. It's also worth mentioning one of the 
        most important ways you should not try to "help" The OpenBSD project:
        do not waste your time engaging in operating system flame wars on
        Usenet newsgroups. It does not help the project to find new users and
        can cause substantial harm to important relationships that developers
        have with other developers.
        <!--Team uses learns from respects many different systems presume
            dictate what others should use--></li>
</ul>

<h2>1.6 - Who maintains OpenBSD?</h2>
</p>

<p>
OpenBSD is maintained by a development team spread across many different
countries. The project is coordinated by Theo de Raadt, located in Canada.
