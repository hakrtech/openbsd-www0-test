<h1>8.0 - General Questions</h1>
<p>
<a name="8.1"></a>
<h2>8.1 - What are these kerberos warning when i first login?</h2>
<p>
When you first install your system you will most likely notice a warning message that is something like this:<br>
<p>
<strong>Warning: no Kerberos tickets issued.</strong>
<p>
<strong>THIS WARNING IS COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT AND SHOULD ONLY BE REMOVED IF COMP
LETELY NECESSARY</STRONG>
<p>

Well since you probobly havent set up kerberos on your system, you wouldnt be getting a ticket. If you do have kerberos running, you need to check into that.<Putlink here to kerberos setup>. If you cant STAND that warning and never plan on using kerberos here is how to get rid of it for good.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have the source code.
<li>Edit /usr/share/mk/bsd.own.mk and set KERBEROS to 'no', or create an /etc/mk.conf file that does this. 
<li>cd /usr/src/usr.bin/login ; make clean ; make ; make install 
</ul>

<h2>8.2 - How do i change virtual terminals?</h2>
<p>
Simply put - <strong>[ctrl] - [alt] - [One of the function keys]
</strong>
<p>

<h2>8.3 - I forgot my root password, what do i do now?</h2>
<p>
A few steps to recovery
<ul>
<li>1 - Boot into single user mode. For i386 arch type boot -s at the boot prompt.
<li>2 - mount the drives.
<ul>
<li><strong>bsd# fsck -p / && mount -u /</strong>
<li> if /usr is on a different partition you need to mount that also
</ul>
<li>3 - type <strong>passwd</strong>
<li>4 - boot into mulituser mode.. and REMEMBER your password .
</ul>

<h2>8.4 - X wont start, i get tons of error messages</h2>
<p>
After you have X completely setup. And are using an XF86Config that you know works.The problem most likely lies in the machdep.allowapature. You also need to make sure that both:<br>
<p>
<strong>option XSERVER<br>
option APERTURE</strong>
<p>
are in you kernel configuration. [BOTH these are in the GENERIC kernel] Then you need to edit <strong>/etc/sysctl.conf</strong> and set machdep.allowaperture=1. This will allow X to access the aperture driver. This would be set up if the ques
tion during install about whether or not you would be running X was answered cor
rectly. OpenBSD 2.4 requires for all X servers that the aperture driver be set,
because it controls access to the I/O ports on video boards.
<p>
<br> Other X problems on the i386, consult the XFree86 FAQ 
<a href="http://www.xfree86.org/FAQ/">here</a>.

<h2>8.5 - What is CVS? and How do i use it?</h2>
<p>
CVS is what the OpenBSD project uses to control changes to the source code. CVS stands for <strong>Concurrent Versions System</strong>. You can read more about CVS at <a href="http://www.cyclic.com">http://www.cyclic.com</a>. CVS can be used by the end user to keep up to date with source changes, and changes in the ports tree. 
<p>
CVS makes it extremely simple to download the source via one of the may CVS servers for the project.
<br>
Here are some simple commands to get you going on CVS.
<p>
<strong> For all these commands a CVSROOT variable must be set.</strong>
You can do this by:<br>
<p>
<strong>bsd# setenv CVSROOT anoncvs@anoncvs.ca.openbsd.org:/cvs</strong>
<br>
<p>

It is best to try to find a server that is closest to you. You can obtain a list of CVS servers from <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html">http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html</a>.
<ul>All these commands are run from the /usr directory.
<li>If you do not have the source code already.
<ul>
<li><strong>bsd# cvs -q get -PAd src</strong> [to get source code] or
<li><strong>bsd# cvs -q get -PAd ports</strong> [to get the ports tree]
</ul>
<li>If you already have and existing source or ports tree.
<ul>
<li><strong>bsd# cvs -q up -PAd src</strong>
<li><strong>bsd# cvs -q up -PAd ports</strong> 
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
There are many different connections you can make to a CVS server. This is to accompany people from all types of networks, whether you are behind a firewall.. etc.
<p>
You can make either a ssh, rsh, or pserver connection to the servers. Many servers also run ssh on port 2022.

<h2>8.6 - What is the ports tree?</h2>
<p>
The ports tree is a set of userland programs that are modified (if needed) to compile and run in an OpenBSD environment. You can get the ports tree from any of the OpenBSD ftp servers in <br> 
<strong>2.4/ports.tar.gz<br></strong>
<p>
Ports are set up to be EXTREMELY easy to make and install. Here is an example install for someone wanting to install the shell zsh.
<p>
<strong>bsd# cd /usr/ports/shells/zsh
<br>
bsd# make install
</strong>
<p>
You can see a list of both ports and packages by using the pkg_info command.

<pre>
bsd# /usr/sbin/pkg_info
zsh-3.0.5           The Z shell.
screen-3.7.4        A multi-screen window manager.

<h2> 8.7 - What are packages?</h2>
<p>
Packages are the precompiled binaries of some of the most used programs. They are ready for use on an OpenBSD system. Again, like the ports, packages are very easy to maintain and update. <br>
<p>
Here is a sample user installing ispell via a package:<br>
<p>
<strong>bsd# pkg_add ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.4/packages/${arch}/ispell-3.1.20.tgz</strong>
<p>
where ${arch} is your architecture<p>

Again, like with ports you can use the pkg_info program to view what is already installed on your system. <p>
To delete packages you will want to use the pkg_delete command. It is used the same way as pkg_add.<p>
<strong>bsd# /usr/sbin/pkg_delete ispell-3.1.20</strong> <br>
and it is gone.
<p>
Packages can be found on the ftp sites or your OpenBSD 2.4 CD's
