<h2>8.1 - What are these Kerberos warning when I first login?</h2>
</p>

<p>
When you first install your system you will most likely notice a warning
message that is something like this:
</p>

<p>
<kbd>
Warning: no Kerberos tickets issued.
</kbd>
</p>

<p>
<strong>
THIS WARNING IS COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT AND SHOULD ONLY BE REMOVED IF COMPLETELY 
NECESSARY
</strong>
<p>

<p>
Well since you probably haven't set up Kerberos on your system, you wouldn't be 
getting a ticket. If you do have Kerberos running, you need to check into that.
<!--Put link here to Kerberos setup-->
If you can't STAND that warning and never plan on using Kerberos here is how 
to get rid of it for good.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure you have the source code.</li>
    <li>Edit /usr/share/mk/bsd.own.mk and set KERBEROS to 'no', or create an 
        /etc/mk.conf file that does this.  </li>
    <li>cd /usr/src/usr.bin/login ; make clean ; make ; make install</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>8.2 - How do I change virtual terminals?</h2>
</p>

<p>
Simply type <kbd>[ctrl] - [alt] - [One of the function keys]</kbd> or just hit
<kbd>[f9]-[f12]</kbd> which are just mapped to <kdb>[ctrl] - [alt]</kbd>
functions. (i386)
</p>

<p>
Only the i386 arch has virtual terminal capabilities. You can also use
virtual terminals when using X. For example, If you start X on term 1, and
switch with [ctrl]-[alt]-[F2] to term 2, X will seem to disapear and will
not come back by simply switching back to term 1. You must
[ctrl]-[alt]-[F5] to get your X display back.
</p>

<br>

<p>
<a name= "8.3"></a>
<h2>8.3 - I forgot my root password, what do I do now?</h2>
</p>

<p>
A few steps to recovery
<ol>
    <li>Boot into single user mode. For i386 arch type boot -s at the boot prompt.
    <li>mount the drives.
    <ul>
        <li><kbd>bsd# fsck -p / && mount -u /</kbd>
        <li> if /usr is on a different partition you need to mount that also
    </ul>
    <li>type <kbd>passwd</kbd>
    <li>boot into mulituser mode.. and REMEMBER your password .
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<a name= "8.4"></a>
<h2>8.4 - X wont start, I get tons of error messages</h2>
</p>

<p>
If you have X completely set up and you are using an XF86Config that you know 
works then the problem most likely lies in the machdep.allowapature. You also 
need to make sure that both:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
option XSERVER
option APERTURE
</pre>
</p>

<p>
are in you kernel configuration. [BOTH these are in the GENERIC kernel] 
</p>

<p>
Then you need to edit <kdb>/etc/sysctl.conf</kbd> and set 
machdep.allowaperture=1. This will allow X to access the aperture driver. This
would be set up if the question during install about whether or not you would
be running X was answered correctly. OpenBSD  requires for all X servers 
that the aperture driver be set, because it controls access to the I/O ports
on video boards.
</p>

<p>
For other X problems on the i386, consult the XFree86 FAQ at 
<a href= "http://www.xfree86.org/FAQ/">http://www.xfree86.org/FAQ/</a>.

<h2>8.5 - What is CVS? and How do I use it?</h2>
</p>

<p>
CVS is what the OpenBSD project uses to control changes to the source code.
CVS stands for Concurrent Versions System. You can read more about CVS at 
<a href= "http://www.cyclic.com/">http://www.cyclic.com/</a>. CVS can be used
by the end user to keep up to date with source changes, and changes in the
ports tree. CVS makes it extremely simple to download the source via one of the many CVS
mirrors for the project.
</p>


<h3>How to initially setup your CVS environment</h3>

<p>
There are a few ways to initially set up your CVS environment. To start off it's you will need an initial CVS
checkout of the sources. If you bought the CD your in luck, because it holds the CVS checkout for that release. 
You can extract it off of your CD by doing the following:
</p>


<p>
If you don't have an OpenBSD CD, you will have to retrieve the sources from on of the OpenBSD AnonCVS servers.
These servers are listed on <a href="../anoncvs.html">http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html</a> Once you have
chosen a server you need to choose which module you are going to retrieve. There are three main modules availible
for checkout from the CVS tree. These are:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>src</i> - The src module has the complete source code for OpenBSD. This includes userland and kernel sources.</li>
<li><i>ports</i> - The ports module holds all you need to have the complete OpenBSD ports tree. To read more on the OpenBSD ports tree, read <a href="faq8.html#8.6">Section 8.6</a> of the OpenBSD FAQ.</li>
<li><i>www</i> - The www module contains all OpenBSD web pages, including this FAQ.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now that you have decided which module that you wish to retrieve, there is one more step left before you can
retrive it. You must decide in which method you will retrive it. CVS by default retrieves files using rsh(1), but
some AnonCVS servers don't allow for this so in most cases it's best to use ssh. For those of you behind a
firewall there are also the options of pserver and some AnonCVS servers run ssh on port 2022. Be sure to check <a href="../anoncvs.html">http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html</a> 
for which servers support what protocols. Next I will show how to do a simple source checkout. Here I will be
using an AnonCVS server located in the U.S., but remember that if you are outside of the U.S you need to use a
server that is also located there. There are many AnonCVS servers located throughout the world, so choose one
nearest you. I will also be using ssh to retrieve the files.
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
ericj@oshibana:~> <strong>export CVS_RSH=/usr/local/bin/ssh</strong>
ericj@oshibana:~> <strong>echo $CVS_RSH</strong>
/usr/local/bin/ssh
ericj@oshibana:~> <strong>export CVSROOT=anoncvs@anoncvs.usa.openbsd.org:/cvs</strong>
ericj@oshibana:~> <strong>cvs get src</strong>
Warning: Remote host denied X11 forwarding, perhaps xauth program could not be run on the server side.
cvs checkout: in directory src:
cvs checkout: cannot open CVS/Entries for reading: No such file or directory
cvs server: Updating src
U src/Makefile
[snip]
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
Notice here also that I set the CVSROOT environmental variable. This is the variable that tells cvs(1) which
AnonCVS server to use. This can also be specified using the <i>-d</i> option. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
ericj@oshibana:~><strong>cvs -d anoncvs@anoncvs.usa.openbsd.org:/cvs get src</strong>
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
These commands should be run in <i>/usr</i>, which will then create the directories of <i>/usr/src</i>,
<i>/usr/ports</i>, and <i>/usr/www</i>. Depending, of course, on which module you checkout. You can download
these modules to anywhere, but if you wanted to do work with them (ie make build ), it is expected that they be
at the place above.
</p>

<h3>Keeping your CVS tree up-to-date</h3>

<p>
Once you have your initial tree setup, keeping it up-to-date is the easy part. You can update your tree at any
time you choose, some AnonCVS servers update more often then others, so again check <a href="../anoncvs.html">http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html</a>.
In this example I will be updating my www module from anoncvs.usa.openbsd.org. Notice the -q option that I use,
this makes the output not so verbose coming from the server.
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
ericj@oshibana:~> <strong>echo $CVSROOT</strong>                                 
anoncvs@anoncvs.usa.openbsd.org:/cvs
ericj@oshibana:~> <strong>cvs -q up -PAd www</strong>
Warning: Remote host denied X11 forwarding, perhaps xauth program could not be run on the server side.
? www/faq/Makefile
? www/faq/txtdump.sh
U www/want.html
M www/faq/faq8.html
ericj@oshibana:~>
</pre>
</ul>

<h3>Other cvs options</h3>

<p>
For some, bandwidth and time are serious problems when updating
repositories such as these. So CVS has a -z[1-9] option which uses gzip to
compress the data. To use it, do -z[compression-level], for instance, -z3
for a compression level of 3.
</p>

<h2>8.6 - What is the ports tree?</h2>
</p>

<p>
The ports tree is a set of Makefiles that download, patch, configure and 
install userland programs so you can run them an OpenBSD environment without
having to do all that by hand. You can get the ports tree from any of the
OpenBSD ftp servers in <kbd>/pub/OpenBSD/2.5/ports.tar.gz</kbd> or try the
latest updates in <kbd>/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/ports.tar.gz</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
If you want to run one of the latest ports collections, you'll need to update
your <kbd>/usr/share/mk/</kbd> directory. CVS up your <kbd>/usr/src/</kbd>
directory and do a:
<pre>
# cd /usr/src/share/mk/
# make install
</pre>
first.
</p>

<p>
A snapshot of the ports tree is also created daily and can be downloaded from any of the <a href="../ftp.html">OpenBSD
ftp servers</a> as <strong>/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/ports.tar.gz</strong>.
</p>

<p>
In 2.5-current this information is now stored in the ports tree. In
<strong>ports/infrastructure/</strong> all that's left in /usr/src/share/mk
for ports is just a pointer to this new area. So, once you have the ports
working with the infrastructure dir, you no longer need to do the step from
above.
</p>


<p>
Ports are set up to be EXTREMELY easy to make and install. Here is an example install for someone wanting to install the 
X11 program xfig. You'll notice the dependencies are automatically detected and completed:
</p>

<p>
First you need to cd to the dir of the program you want. If you are searching for a program, you can either update your
locate database, or use the search function talked about below. Once you are in the dir of the program you want, you
can just type make install. For example. <br>

<a name= "8.7"></a>
<h2>8.7 - What are packages?</h2>
</p>

<p>
Packages are the precompiled binaries of some of the most used programs. They
are ready for use on an OpenBSD system. Again, like the ports, packages are 
very easy to maintain and update. Packages are constantly being added so
be sure to check each release for additional packages.
</p>
<p>
Here is a list of tools used in managing packages.<br>
<ul>
<li>pkg_add (1) - a utility for installing software package distributions</li>
<li>pkg_create (1) - a utility for creating software package distributions</li>
<li>pkg_delete (1) - a utility for deleting previously installed software package distributions</li>
<li>pkg_info (1) - a utility for displaying information on software packages</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here is a sample user installing ispell via a package:
</p>

<p>
<kbd>bsd# pkg_add
ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.5/packages/${arch}/ispell-3.1.20.tgz</kbd>
<br>
where ${arch} is your architecture
</p>

<p>
Again, like with ports you can use the pkg_info(1) program to view what is 
already installed on your system. 
</p>

<p>
To delete packages you will want to use the pkg_delete(1) command. It is
used the same way as pkg_add(1).
</p>

<p>
<kbd>bsd# /usr/sbin/pkg_delete ispell-3.1.20</kbd>
</p>

<p>
and it is gone.
</p>

<p>
Packages can be found on any of the OpenBSD ftp mirror sites.<br>
<a href="../ftp.html">Http://www.OpenBSD.org/ftp.html</a><br>
or they can be found on your OpenBSD CD's.
</p>

<p>
<a name= "8.8"></a>
<h2>8.8 -  Is there any way to use my floppy drive if it's not attached during boot?</h2>
</p>

<p>
Sure. You need to add "flags 0x20" at the end of the fd* entry and
recompile your kernel. The line should be read:
</p>
<strong>  fd*     at fdc? drive ? flags 0x20</strong>

<p>
After that you would be able to use the floppy drive all the time. It
doesn't matter if you plugged it later after boot.
</p>

<p>
<a name= "8.9"></a>
<h2>8.9 - Boot time Options - Using the OpenBSD bootloader</h2>
</p>

<p>
When booting your OpenBSD system, many of you have probably noticed the boot
prompt.
<p>

<p>
<strong>boot></strong>
</p>

<p>
For most people, you won't have to do anything here. It will automatically boot if
no commands are given. But sometimes problems arise, or special functions are
needed. That's where these options will come in handy. To start of, you should read
through the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=boot&sektion=8&format=html">boot(8)</a>
man page. Here we will go over the most common used commands for the bootloader.
</p>

<p>
To start off, if no commands are issued, the bootloader will automatially try to
boot <strong>/bsd</strong>. If that fails it will try <strong>/obsd</strong>, and
so on till it finds a bootable kernel. You can specify this by hand by typing:
</p>
<p>
<strong>
boot> boot wd0a:/bsd
<br>or<br>
boot> b /bsd
</strong>
</p>

<p>
This will work if device wd0a is configured as your root device.
</p>

<p>
<ul>Here is a quick overview of options to be used with the boot parameter.
<li><strong>-a</strong> : This will allow you to specify an alternate root device after booting the kernel.</li>
<li><strong>-c</strong> : This allows you to enter the boot time configuration.
			  Check the <a href="faq5.html#5.4"> Boot Time Config </a>section of the faq.</li>
<li><strong>-s</strong> : This is the option to boot into single user mode.</li>
<li><strong>-d</strong> : This option is used to dump the kernel into ddb. Keep in
			mind that you must have DDB built into the kernel.</li>
<li><strong>-b</strong> : Shortcut for RB_HALT.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
These are entered in the format of:<br>
<strong>boot [ image [-abcds]]</strong>
</p>

<p>
For further reading you can read <a href="http://www.OpenBSD.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=boot_i386&sektion=8&format=html">boot_i386(8)</a>

<a name="8.10">
<h2>8.10 - S/Key</h2>
</p>

<p>
S/Key is a ``one-time password'' scheme. This allows for one-time passwords for use on un-secured channels. This can come very handy
for those who don't have the ability to use ssh or any other encrypted channels. OpenBSD's S/Key implimentation can use a variety of
algorithm's as the one-way hash. Here is the list of algorithm's availible:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=md4&sektion=3&format=html">md4</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=md5&sektion=3&format=html">md5</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sha1&sektion=3&format=html">sha1</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rmd160&sektion=3&format=html">rmd160</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Setting up S/Key - The first steps </h3>

<p>
To start of the file <i>/etc/skeykeys</i> must exist. If this file is not in existance, have the super-user create it. This can be
done simply by doing:
</p>

<ul>
<strong><pre>
# touch /etc/skeykeys
</strong></pre>
</ul>

<p>
Once that file is in existance, you can initalize your S/Key. To do this you will have to use <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=skeyinit&sektion=1&format=html">skeyinit(1)</a>.
With skeyinit(1), you will first be prompted for your password to the system. This is the same password that you used to log into the
system. Running skeyinit(1) over an insecure channel is completely not recommended, so this should be done over a secure channel
(such as ssh) or the console. Once you have authorized yourself with your system password you will be asked for yet another password.
This password is the <i>secret password</i>, and is <strong>NOT</strong> your system password. The secret password is not limited to
8 characters like system passwords, actually it must be at least 10 characters. A few word phrases are suggested. Here is an example
user being added.
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
oshibana:ericj> <strong>skeyinit ericj</strong>
[Adding ericj]
Reminder - Only use this method if you are directly connected
           or have an encrypted channel.  If you are using telnet
           or rlogin, exit with no password and use skeyinit -s.
Enter secret password:
Again secret password:

ID ericj skey is otp-md5 99 oshi45820             
Next login password: HAUL BUS JAKE DING HOT HOG
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
One line of particular importance in here is <i>ID ericj skey is otp-md5 99 oshi45820</i>. This gives alot of information to the
user. Here is a breakdown of the sections and their importance.
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>otp-md5</i> - This shows which one-way has was used to create your One-Time Password (otp).</li>
<li><i>99</i> - This is your sequence number. This is a number from 100 down to 1. Once it reaches one, another secret password must be created. </li>
<li><i>oshi45820</i> - This is your key. </li>
</ul>

<p>
But of more immediate importance is your password. Your password consists of 6 small words, combined together this is your password,
spaces and all. 
</p>

<h3>Actually using S/Key to login.</h3>

<p>
By now your skey has been initialized, and you have your password. You're ready to login. Here is an example session using s/key to
login.
</p>

<ul>

<p>
Some of you might have noticed that my sequence number has changed. <i>otp-md5 96 oshi45820</i>. This is because by now i have used
s/key to login several times. But how do you get your password after you've logged in once? Well to do this, you'll need to know what
sequence number your using and your key. As you're probobly thinking, how can you remember which sequence number your on? Well this
is simple, use <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=skeyinfo&sektion=1&format=html">skeyinfo(1)</a>, and it will
tell you what to use. For example here, I need to generate another password for a login that I might have to make in the future.
(remember I'm doing this from a secure channel).
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
oshibana:ericj> <strong>skeyinfo</strong>
95 oshi45820
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
From this I can create the password for my next login. To do so, I'll use <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=skey&sektion=1&format=html">skey(1)</a>.
I can use exactly that output from above to create my password.
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
oshibana:ericj> <strong>skey 95 oshi45820</strong>
Reminder - Do not use this program while logged in via telnet or rlogin.
Enter secret password:
NOOK CHUB HOYT SAC DOLE FUME
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
I'm sure many of you won't always have a secure connect to create these passwords, and creating them over an insecure connection
isn't feasible, so how can you create multiple passwords at one time? Well you can supply skey(1) with a number of how many passwords
you want created. This can then be printed out and taken with you wherever you go. 
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
oshibana:ericj> <strong>skey -n 5 95 oshi45820</strong>
Reminder - Do not use this program while logged in via telnet or rlogin.
Enter secret password:
91: SHIM SET LEST HANS SMUG BOOT
92: SUE ARTY YAW SEED KURD BAND
93: JOEY SOOT PHI KYLE CURT REEK
94: WIRE BOGY MESS JUDE RUNT ADD
95: NOOK CHUB HOYT SAC DOLE FUME
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
Notice here though, that the bottom password should be the first used, because we are counting down from 100.
</p>

<h3>Controlling S/Key</h3>

<p>
For more control over S/Key there is the <i>/etc/skey.access</i> file. (This does not exist by default, so it must be created.) This
file can restrict S/Key in three primary ways.
</p>

<ul>
<li>permit internet - Which will allow certain IPs to connect and use s/key.</li>
<li>permit user - Which will allow users by login name access to s/key use. </li>
<li>permit port - Which is really only useful for assigned ports, (ie  dial-up)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If I wanted to allow one single user ( ericj ), from a certain IP ( 10.1.1.5 ), I would create a file like so.
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
# <strong>cat /etc/skey.access</strong>
permit internet 10.1.1.5
permit user ericj
</pre>
</ul>
