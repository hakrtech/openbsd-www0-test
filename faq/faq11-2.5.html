<h2>11.1 - Swapping in OpenBSD 2.5</h2>
</p>

<p>
(Note: if you are looking to swap to a file because you are getting
&quot;virtual memory exhausted&quot; errors, you should try raising
the per-process limits first with
csh's <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=unlimit&sektion=1&format=html">unlimit(1)</a>,
or
sh's <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ulimit&sektion=1&format=html">ulimit(1)</a>.)
</p>

<p>
OpenBSD 2.5 uses <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=swapon&sektion=8&format=html">swapon</a>
to deal with swapping. Swapping to a file doesn't require a custom built kernel, although that can still be done, this faq
will show you how to add swap space both ways.
</p>

<h3>Swapping to a file. </h3>

<p>
Swapping to a file is easiest and quickest way to get extra swap area's setup. This is not for users who
are currently using Softupdates. (Which isn't enabled by default).
To start out, you can see how much swap you are currently have and how much you are using with the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pstat&sektion=8&format=html">pstat(8)</a>
utility. You can do this by using the command:
</p>

<ul><pre>
ericj@oshibana> <strong>pstat -s</strong>
Device      512-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Priority
swap_device      65520        8    65512     0%    0
</pre></ul>

<p>
This shows the devices currently being used for swapping and their current statistics. In the above
example there is only one device named &quot;swap_device&quot;. This is the predefined area on disk that
is used for swapping. (Shows up as partition b when viewing disklabels) As you can also see in the above
example, that device isn't getting much use at the moment. But for the purposes of this document, we
will act as if an extra 32M is needed.
</p>
<p>
The first step to setting up a file as a swap device is to create the file. It's best to do this with
the <a href="href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dd&sektion=1&format=html">dd(1)</a>
utility. Here is an example of creating the file <i>/var/swap</i> that is 32M large.
</p>

<ul><pre>
ericj@oshibana> <strong>sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swap bs=1k count=32768</strong>
32768+0 records in
32768+0 records out
33554432 bytes transferred in 20 secs (1677721 bytes/sec)
</ul></pre>

<p>
Once this has been done, we can turn on swapping to that device. Use the following command to turn on
swapping to this device
</p>

<ul><pre>
ericj@oshibana> <strong>sudo swapon -a /var/swap</strong>
</ul></pre>

<p>
Now we need to check to see if it has been correctly added to the list of our swap devices.
</p>

<ul><pre>
ericj@oshibana> <strong>pstat -s</strong>
Device      512-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Priority
swap_device      65520        8    65512     0%    0
/var/swap        65536        0    65536     0%    0
Total           131056        8   131048     0%
</ul></pre>

<p>
Now that the file is setup and swapping is being done, you need to add a line to your <i>/etc/fstab</i>
file so that this file is configured on the next boot time also. If this line is not added, your won't
have this swap device configured.
</p>

<ul><pre>
ericj@oshibana> <strong>cat /etc/fstab</strong>
/dev/wd0a / ffs rw 1 1
/var/swap /var/swap sw 0 0
</ul></pre>

<h3>Swapping via a vnode device</h3>

<p>
This is a more permenant solution to adding more swap space. To swap to a file permanently, first make a
kernel with vnd0c as swap. If you have wd0a as root filesystem, wd0b is the previous swap, use this line
in the kernel configuration file (refer to compiling a new kernel if in doubt):
</p>

<ul><pre>
config          bsd     root on wd0a swap on wd0b and vnd0c dumps on wd0b
</ul></pre>

<p>
After this is done, the file which will be used for swapping needs to be created. You should do this by
using the same command as in the above examples.
</p>

<ul><pre>
ericj@oshibana> <strong>sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swap bs=1k count=32768</strong>
32768+0 records in
32768+0 records out
33554432 bytes transferred in 20 secs (1677721 bytes/sec)
</ul></pre>

<p>
Now your file is in place, you need to add the file to you <i>/etc/fstab</i>. Here is a sample line to
boot with this device as swap on boot.
</p>

<ul><pre>
ericj@oshibana> <strong>cat /etc/fstab</strong>
/dev/wd0a / ffs rw 1 1
/dev/vnd0c none swap sw 0 0
</ul></pre>

<p>
At this point your computer needs to be rebooted so that the kernel changes can take place. Once this
has been done it's time to configure the device as swap. To do this you will use <a
href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=vnconfig&sektion=1&format=html">vnconfig(1)</a>.
</p>

<ul><pre>
ericj@oshibana> <strong>sudo vnconfig -c -v vnd0 /var/swap</strong>
vnd0: 33554432 bytes on /var/swap
</ul></pre>

<p>
Now for the last step, turning on swapping to that device. We will do this just like in the above
examples, using swapon(8). Then we will check to see if it was correctly added to our list of swap
devices.
</p>

<ul><pre>
ericj@oshibana> <strong>sudo swapon -a /dev/vnd0c</strong>
ericj@oshibana> <strong>pstat -s</strong>
Device      512-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Priority
swap_device      65520        8    65512     0%    0
/dev/vnd0c       65536        0    65536     0%    0
Total           131056        8   131048     0%
</ul></pre>

<h2>11.2 - Tuning kmem</h2>
</p>


<P>
If you are running 2.5 (<b>these steps are not necessary for OpenBSD 2.6</b>), and if
you start using the <A href="faq11.html">performance tuning measures</a>, you may start
running out of kernel memory.  If you start getting
panics like "out of space in kmem_map" then you need to try
<UL>
<strong>
option NKMEMCLUSTERS=8192<BR>
</strong>
</UL>
Note that 8192 is valid for the i386 architecture, but may be too
little or too much for others. Look at /usr/include/machine/param.h
to see more information.
<P>
If you ever get a panic "vm_map_entry_create: out of map entries", you 
may also want to increase the number of static kernel maps and entries.
The default value for these options is architecture dependent and is specified
in /sys/vm/vm_map.h. If you are using soft updates, the following values should 
keep you going!
<UL>
<strong>
option MAX_KMAP=120<BR>
option MAX_KMAPENT=6000<BR>
</strong>
</ul>
<br>
