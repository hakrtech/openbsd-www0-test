<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Why won't XFree86 load on</A>my (insert really cool/expensive, youknow-it-will-work-because-you-checked-it-on-the-compatability-listat xfree86.org)  graphics card?</H2>

<P>Some of the X servers require direct access to
"<CODE>/dev/mem</CODE>" (raw memory) in order to work. By default,
the OpenBSD kernel does not allow for this.  There are two
solutions:</P>


<P>
<UL>
<LI>recompile a kernel with "option insecure" in your
configuration file.
</LI>
<LI>Use the "apature" Loadable Kernel Module (lkm) found in
the X11 distribution.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>In addition, the Matrox Millenium and possibly other cards
may require BOTH lkm be loaded as well as option insecure.</P>
