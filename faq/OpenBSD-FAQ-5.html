<H2><A NAME="s5">5. How do I rebuild my system?</A></H2>

<P>Depending on what version system you have and what version
source you have, it can be as easy as four steps, and as lengthy
as 22. If you have a 2.1 CD (or downloaded 2.1) and are using
"<CODE>-current</CODE>" sources, you should be able to recompile in
four steps. In order to get 2.1 (and later) versions to compile
on a 2.0 based system, things get a little tricky.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 "The Four Steps" (as opposed to the Four Questions)</A></H2>

<P>If you want to be risky, you can just try doing a "<CODE>make
-k build</CODE>" in <CODE>/usr/src</CODE> --- the four steps below follow
a prudent guideline for making a new system.</P>

</LI>
<LI>builds the entire system. "<CODE>-k</CODE>" is a flag to make that
tries to have make progress if there are any errors. "<CODE>make
build</CODE>" also builds the dependencies. "<CODE>make install</CODE>"
makes SURE it gets installed --- "<CODE>make build</CODE>" is supposed
to do the installing.

<P>These are very detailed instructions given to
misc@OpenBSD.ORG from Marco Hyman. If you aren't too paranoid,
you can actually skip some of the stuff in there, at your own
risk. Please read through carefully. If you aren't careful,
you can actually hose your system up <B>:(</B></P>

Subject: From 2.0 to current in 22 steps

Someone (Theo?) recently said that updating from a 2.0 to
current was a bitch.  That sounded enough like a challenge
that I thought I'd try it --- and document what I had to do at
the same time.  Hope this is helpful to others.

Given:
 o System running 2.0 code
 o -current source tree mounted as /usr/src.  My -current
   source lives on a different host, so it happens to be
   NFS mounted.  This code was current as of 1 May.
 o An empty /usr/obj on the local disk.

Variables:

 * $arch=i386, the architecture I'm generating the
   code for
 * $config=TRAVEL, my configuration file.  This is a copy
   of ALL with everything I don't use commented out and a
   few minor changes. Travel is a Toshiba laptop and I wanted
   the PCMCIA modem to be com1 and the PCMCIA ethernet card
   to be either ed0 or ep0, depending upon which flavor or
   card I happen to be using.

Ok, here are the steps.  Disclaimer mode:
 - Some may not be necessary.
 - There may be necessary steps that I missed and just luckely
   have not run into problems yet.
 - The order that I did things may be wrong.
 - Etc.

masterpiece rivaling the Magna Carta :) ]


 [ 1] cd /usr/src/share/mk && make install
      use the new make for everything

 [ 2] cd /usr/src/includes && make includes
      use the new included for everything

 [ 3] cd /usr/src/bin/pdksh && make && make install && make clean
      This is installed as /bin/sh which is needed for the next
      step.
      The 2.0 /bin/sh does not work with making the object links.
      The `make clean' step is to get the $arch specific objects
      out of the source directory.

 [ 4] cd /usr/src && make obj
      make the obj links so that code is generated on the local
      disk, not the NFS mounted source disk.  (Note: the kernel
      is still generated in /sys/arch/$arch/compile/$config).

 [ 5] cd /usr/src/usr.bin/mktemp && make && make install
      mktemp is required to generate a kernel

 [ 6] cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/config && make depend && make && make
      install The latest config MUST be used to generate the new
      kernel. If you don't use this config you won't get past
      the &quot;make depend&quot; step of kernel generation.

 [ 7] cd /sys/arch/$arch/conf edit your $config file if
      necessary.

 [ 8] config $config
      generate required files to build updated kernel.

 [ 9] cd ../compile/$config && make clean && make depend && make
      Don't forget the make clean.  It may not be necessary, but
      doesn't hurt in any case.  The new config may have even
      warned you to do this.

 [10] mv /bsd /bsd- && mv bsd /
      Get ready...


 [11] reboot
      Reboot your box and watch the console to see what's going
      on. In my case all went well.  Xdm started and gave me my
      console login. I ssh'd from another host, su'd, and then
      re-mounted the current source on /usr/src.
      &quot;uname -a&quot; says:

        OpenBSD travel.codewright.com 2.1 TRAVEL#0 i386

 [12] cd /usr/src && make cleandir
      We start with this step of the build process because the 
      /usr/src/share/mk and the include files were installed
      above.

 [13] cd /usr/src/usr.bin/compile_et && make depend && make &&
      make install this tool is required to build the libraries.

 [14] cd /usr/src/usr.bin/mk_cmds && make depend && make && make
      install this tool is required to build the libraries

 [15] cd /usr/src/lib && make depend && make && make install
      Go and have dinner then see a movie.  This should be done
      just about the time you get back to the console.  At least
      that's how long it takes on my old pentium portable.

 [16] cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/ld && make depend && make && make
      install needed for the gnu libraries (libg++ will fail)

 [17] cd /usr/src/gnu/lib && make depend && make && make install

 [18] cd /usr/src/kerberosIV && make build

 [19] cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/texinfo && \
      make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper && \
      make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install
      The updated makeinfo is required by gcc which is generated
      before makeinfo when doing a standard `make'

 [20] cd /usr/src && make depend && make && make install

 [21] reboot
      See that everything comes up.  If your source lives on a
      remote machine (like mine does), mount it on /usr/src.

 [22] cd /usr/src && make build
      This step is optional.  I like to use the generated
      system to regenerate the full system just to ensure
      that all is OK.
      Probably best to start this before you go to bed.
      It might be done by the time you wake up.

As I type this I've completed steps 1-21.  Step 22 is in
progress.  I'll mail out an update if I run into any problems.
Again, I hope this is helpful to others.
