<h3>What is disklabel(8)?</h3>
   
<p>
Disklabel's are created to allow an efficient interface between your disk
and the disk drivers contained within the kernel. Labels hold certain 
information about your disk, like your drive geometry and information
about your filesystems. This is then used by the bootstrap program to load
the drive and to know where filesystems are contained on the drive. Labels are
also used in conjunction with the filesystems to create a more efficient
environment. You can read more in-depth information about disklabel by
reading the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&sektion=5&format=html">disklabel(5)</a>
man page.
</p> 

<p>
As an additional gain, using disklabel helps overcome architecture
limitations on disk partitioning. For example, on i386, you can only
have 4 primary partitions. (Partitions that other operating systems,  
such as Windows NT or DOS can see.) With disklabel(8), you use one of   
these 'primary' partitions to store *all* of your OpenBSD partitions  
(eg. 'swap', '/', '/usr' and '/var'). And you still have 3 more
partitions available for other OSs!
</p>

<a name="14.1.2"></a>
<h3>disklabel(8) during OpenBSD's install</h3>

<p>
One of the major parts of OpenBSD's install is your initial creation of
labels. This comes (for i386 users) directly after using <a href="#14.2">fdisk(1)</a>.
During the install you use disklabel to create your separate labels which
will contain your separate mountpoints. During the install, you can set
your mountpoints from within disklabel(8), but this isn't completely
necessary considering you will be prompted later to confirm you choices.
But it does make your install go just a little smoother.
</p>

<p>
Since this is during the install you won't have any existing labels, and
they will need to be created. The first label you will create is the label
'a'. This label SHOULD be your where / will be mounted. You can see
recommended partitions that should be created and their sizes by
reading <a href="faq4.html#4.3">faq4.3</a>. For servers it is recommended
that you create at least these label's separately. For desktop users
creating one mountpoint at / will probobly suffice. When initially
creating your root partition ( 'a' label ), keep in mind that you will 
need SOME space left for your swap label. Now that the basics have been
explained, here is an example of using disklabel during an install. In   
this first example it is assumed that OpenBSD will be the only operating
system on this computer, and that a full install will be done.
</p>

<ul><pre>

If this disk is shared with other operating systems, those operating systems
should have a BIOS partition entry that spans the space they occupy completely.
For safety, also make sure all OpenBSD file systems are within the offset and
size specified in the 'A6' BIOS partition table.  (By default, the disklabel
editor will try to enforce this).  If you are unsure of how to use multiple
partitions properly (ie. seperating /,  /usr, /tmp, /var, /usr/local, and other
things) just split the space into a root and swap partition for now.

# using MBR partition 3: type A6 off 63 (0x3f) size 4991553 (0x4c2a41) 

Treating sectors 63-16386300 as the OpenBSD portion of the disk.
You can use the 'b' command to change this.

Initial label editor (enter '?' for help at any prompt)
> <strong>d a</strong>
> <strong>a a</strong>
offset: [63] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
size: [16386237] <strong>64M</strong>
Rounding to nearest cylinder: 131040
FS type: [4.2BSD] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
mount point: [none] <strong>/</strong>
fragment size: [1024] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
block size: [8192] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
cpg: [16] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
> <strong>a b</strong>
offset: [131103] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
size: [16255197] <strong>64M</strong>
Rounding to nearest cylinder: 131040
FS type: [swap] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
</ul></pre>

<p>
At this point we have created a 64M root partition mounted at /, and a 64Meg swap partition. Notice that
the offset starts at sector 63. This is what you want. When it comes to the size, disklabel will show
your size in sectors, however, you don't need to enter sizes in the same format. Like the example above
you can enter sizes in the manner of <i>64 Megabytes = 64M</i> and <i>2 Gigabytes = 2G</i>. Disklabel
will then round to the nearest cylinder. In the example above you will also notice that disklabel
assumes that label 'b' will be a swap. This is a correct assumption as the GENERIC kernel is set to look
for swap on label 'b', and you should just follow this guideline and use 'b' as your swap area.
</p>

<p>
The next example will take you through the creation of two more labels. This means that it's not a
complete install, as the size of these won't be enough to install OpenBSD to its fullest. 
Showing the creation of all the partitions would just be repetitive.
</p>

<ul><pre>
> <strong>a d</strong>
offset: [262143] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
size: [16124157] <strong>64M</strong>
Rounding to nearest cylinder: 131040
FS type: [4.2BSD] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
mount point: [none] <strong>/tmp</strong>
fragment size: [1024] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
block size: [8192] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
cpg: [16] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
> <strong>a e</strong>
offset: [393183] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
size: [15993117] <strong>64M</strong>
Rounding to nearest cylinder: 131040
FS type: [4.2BSD] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
mount point: [none] <strong>/var</strong>
fragment size: [1024] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
block size: [8192] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
cpg: [16] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
</ul></pre>

<p>
In the above example, there are two things you might notice. One being that the offset is automatically
figured out for you to be the next in order. When doing an install of this sort, you won't need to mess
with changing the offsets at all. Another difference you might notice will be that label 'c' has been
skipped. This is done for a reason, which is that label 'c' is a label that represents the whole disk.
For this reason you shouldn't deal with label 'c' in any way.
</p>

<p>
Once all your labels have been created all thats left to do is write the labels to disk, and move on in
the installation process. To write everything and quit disklabel (and continue with the install) do:
</p>

<ul><pre>
> <strong>w</strong>
> <strong>q</strong>
</ul></pre>

<p>
<strong>*NOTE*</strong> - For user's with large drives. If your bios isn't able to support a drive of that size
OpenBSD cannot support it either. Otherwise OpenBSD should be able to handle your drive just fine. If you are in a 
situation where your bios doesn't support your drive, you can try Maxtor EZ-Drive or other similar overlay product.
</p>

<h3>Common uses for disklabel(8)</h3>

<p>
Once your system is installed, you shouldn't need to use disklabel too often. But some times you will
need to use disklabel are when adding, removing or restructuring your disks. One of the first things
you will need to do is view your current disklabel. To do this simply type:
</p>

<ul><pre>
# <strong>disklabel wd0</strong> <----- Or whatever disk device you'd like to view

# using MBR partition 3: type A6 off 64 (0x40) size 16777152 (0xffffc0)
# /dev/rwd0c:
type: ESDI
disk:
label: TOSHIBA MK2720FC
flags:
bytes/sector: 512
sectors/track: 63
tracks/cylinder: 16
sectors/cylinder: 1008
cylinders: 2633
total sectors: 2654064
rpm: 3600
interleave: 1
trackskew: 0
cylinderskew: 0
headswitch: 0           # milliseconds
track-to-track seek: 0  # milliseconds
drivedata: 0 

16 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize   cpg]
  a:  2071440    65583    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl.   65*- 2120)
  b:    65520       63      swap                        # (Cyl.    0*- 65)
  c:  2654064        0    unused        0     0         # (Cyl.    0 - 2632)
  j:   512001  2137023    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl. 2120*- 2627*)
</ul></pre>

<p>
The above command simply allows you to view the existing disklabel, and assuring that you dont mess
anything up. ( Which we all need sometimes. ) But to be able to make changes you must use the -E option
with disklabel like so:
</p>

<ul><pre>
# <strong>disklabel -E wd0</strong>
</ul></pre>

<p>
<p>
This will bring you to a prompt, the same as the one that you used during the OpenBSD install. Probobly
the single most important command at this prompt is '?'. This will give you a list of possible options
pertaining to disklabel. You can even view the entire disklabel(8) man page with the 'M' command. From
this prompt, you will do all of your adding, deleting and changing of partitions. For additional
information read the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&sektion=8&format=html">disklabel(8)</a>
man page.
</p>

<h2>14.2 - Using fdisk</h2>
</p>
<p>
First be sure to check the fdisk main page. 
<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">fdisk(8)</a>
</p>
<p>
Fdisk is a program to help with the maintenance of your partitions. This
program is used at install time to set up your OpenBSD partition (this
partition can contain <u>several</u> labels, each with filesystems/swap/etc.).
It can divide space on your drives and set one active. This program will
usually be used in Single User Mode ( boot -s ). Fdisk also sets the MBR on
your various hard disks.
</p>

<p>
For installation purposes, most times you'll only need <b>ONE</b> OpenBSD
partition, and then using disklabel to put a swap and a filesystem on it.
</p>

<p>
To just view your partition table using fdisk just use:<br>
<ul>
<pre># <strong>fdisk fd0</strong><br>
</pre>
</ul>

Which will give an output similar to this:
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
         Disk: fd0       geometry: 80/2/18 [2880 sectors]
         Offset: 0       Signatures: 0xAA55,0x0
                  Starting        Ending
          #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
         *0: A6    0   0   1 -   79   1  18 [         0 -       2880] OpenBSD
          1: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused
          2: A7    0   0   2 -   79   1  18 [         1 -       2879] NEXTSTEP
          3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
In this example we are viewing the fdisk output of floppy drive. We can
see the OpenBSD partition (A6) and its size. The * tells us that the
OpenBSD partition is a bootable partition.
</p>

<p>
In the previous example we just viewed our information. What if we want to
edit our partition table? Well, to do so we must use the <b>-e</b> flag.
This will bring up a command line prompt to interact with fdisk.
</p>

<ul>
<PRE>
# <strong>fdisk -e wd0</strong>
Enter 'help' for information
fdisk: 1> <strong>help</strong>
        help            Command help list
        manual          Show entire OpenBSD man page for fdisk
        reinit          Re-initialize loaded MBR (to defaults)
        disk            Edit current drive stats
        edit            Edit given table entry
        flag            Flag given table entry as bootable
        update          Update machine code in loaded MBR
        select          Select extended partition table entry MBR
        print           Print loaded MBR partition table
        write           Write loaded MBR to disk
        exit            Exit edit of current MBR, without saving changes
        quit            Quit edit of current MBR, saving current changes
        abort           Abort program without saving current changes
fdisk: 1> 
</PRE>
</ul>

</p>
<p> 
It is perfectly safe in fdisk to go in and explore, just make sure to answer <Strong>N</strong> to saving
the changes and *DON'T* use the <strong>write</strong> command.
</p>

<p>Here is an overview of the commands you can use when you choose the <b>-e</b> flag.<br>
<ul>
<li><strong>help</strong>    Display a list of commands that fdisk understands in the interactive edit mode.</li>
<li><strong>reinit</strong>  Initialize the currently selected, in-memory copy of the boot block.</li>
<li><strong>disk</strong>    Display the current drive geometry that fdisk has probed. You are given a chance to edit it if you wish.</li>
<li><strong>edit</strong>    Edit a given table entry in the memory copy of the current boot block.  You may edit either in BIOS geometry mode, or in sector offsets and sizes.</li>
<li><strong>flag</strong>    Make the given partition table entry bootable. Only one entry can be marked bootable. If you 
wish to boot from an extended partition, you will need to mark the partition table entry for the extended partition as bootable.</li>
<li><strong>update</strong>  Update the machine code in the memory copy of the currently selected boot block.</li>
<li><strong>select</strong>  Select and load into memory the boot block pointed to by the extended partition table entry in the current boot block.</li>
<li><strong>print</strong>   Print the currently selected in-memory copy of the boot block and its MBR table to the terminal.</li>
<li><strong>write</strong>   Write the in-memory copy of the boot block to disk. You will be asked to confirm this operation.</li>
<li><strong>exit</strong>    Exit the current level of fdisk, either returning to the previously selected in-memory copy of a boot block, or exiting the program if there is none.</li>
<li><strong>quit</strong>    Exit the current level of fdisk, either returning to the previously selected
in-memory copy of a boot block, or exiting the program if there is none.  Unlike exit it does write the modified block out.</li>
<li><strong>abort</strong>   Quit program without saving current changes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>14.3 - Adding extra disks in OpenBSD</h2>
</p>

<p>
Well once you get your disk installed <strong>PROPERLY</strong> you need to use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">fdisk(8)</a>
(<i>i386 only</i
>) and 
<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">
disklabel(8)</a> to set
 up your
disk in OpenBSD.
<P>
For i386 folks, start with fdisk.  Other architectures can ignore this.
<UL><PRE>
# <Strong>fdisk -i sd2</strong>
</ul></pre>
This will initialize the disk's "real" partition table for exclusive use
by OpenBSD.
Next you need to create a disklabel for it.  This will seem confusing.
<UL><PRE>
# <strong>disklabel -e sd2</strong>

<i>(screen goes blank, your $EDITOR comes up)</i>
type: SCSI
<i>...bla...</i>
sectors/track: 63
total sectors: 6185088
<i>...bla...</i>
16 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize   cpg]
  c:  6185088        0    unused        0     0         # (Cyl.    0 - 6135)
  d:  1405080       63    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl.    0*- 1393*)
  e:  4779945  1405143    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl. 1393*- 6135)
</PRE></ul>
First, ignore the 'c' partition, it's always there and is for
programs like disklabel to function! 
For normal operations, fsize should always be 1024, bsize should always be 8192,
and cpg should always be 16.  Fstype is 4.2BSD.  Total sectors is
the total size of the disk.
Say this is a 3 gigabyte disk.  Three gigabytes in disk manufacturer
terms is 3000 megabytes.  So divide 6185088/3000 (use bc(1)).  You get 2061.
So to make up partition sizes for a, d, e, f, g, ... just multiply X*2061
to get X megabytes of space on that partition.   The offset for your
first new partition should be the same as the "sectors/track" reported
earlier in disklabel's output.  For us it is 63.  The offset for each
partition afterwards should be a combination of the size of each partition
and the offset of each partition (Except the C partition, since it has no
play into this equation.)
<P>
Or, if you just want one partition on the disk, say you will use the
whole thing for web storage or a home directory or something,
just take the total size of the disk and subtract the sectors per track from it.
6185088-63 = 6185025.  Your partition is
<UL><PRE>
    d:  6185025       63    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16 
</PRE></UL>
<P>
<b>If all this seems needlessly complex, you can just use disklabel -E to get
the same partitioning mode that you got on your install disk!</b>
There, you can just use "96M" to specify "96 megabytes".  (Or, if you have a disk
big enough, 96G for 96 gigs!) Unfortunately,
the -E mode uses the BIOS disk geometry, not the real disk geometry,
and often times the two are not the same.  To get around this limitation,
type 'g d' for 'geometry disk'.  (Other options are 'g b' for 'geometry bios'
and 'g u' for geometry user, or simply, what the label said before
disklabel made any changes.)
<P>
That was a lot.  But you are not finished.  
Finally, you need to create the filesystem on that disk using <a href=
"http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=newfs
&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">newfs(8)</a>.
</p>

<p>
<ul><pre>
bsd# <strong>newfs wd1a </strong></ul></pre>
</p>

<p>
Or whatever your disk was named as per OpenBSD's disk numbering scheme.  (Look at the
output from dmesg(1) to see what your disk was named by OpenBSD.)
</p>

<p>
Now figure out where you are going to mount this new partition you just created.
Say you want to put it on /u.  First, make the directory /u.  Then, mount it.
</p>

<UL><PRE>
mount /dev/wd1a /u
</PRE></UL>

<P>
Finally, add it to /etc/fstab
</p>
<UL><PRE>/dev/wd1a /u ffs rw 1 1</PRE></UL>

<p>
What if you need to migrate an existing directory like /usr/local? You should mount 
the new drive in /mnt and use cpio -pdum to copy /usr/local to the /mnt directory.
Edit the /etc/fstab file to show that the /usr/local partition is now /dev/wd1a
(your freshly formatted partition.) 
Example:
</p>

<ul>
<strong>/dev/wd1a /usr/local ffs rw 1 1</strong>
</ul>

<p>
Reboot into single user mode..<strong>boot -s</strong> Move the existing
/usr/local to /usr/local-backup (or delete it if you feel lucky) and create an
empty directory /usr/local. Then reboot the system, and whala!! the files are there!

<h2>14.4 - How to swap to a file</h2>
</p>

<p>
(Note: if you are looking to swap to a file because you are getting
&quot;virtual memory exhausted&quot; errors, you should try raising
the per-process limits first with 
csh's <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=unlimit&sektion=1&format=html">unlimit(1)</a>,
or
sh's <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ulimit&sektion=1&format=html">ulimit(1)</a>.)
</p>

<p>
After the release of OpenBSD 2.5 came
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=swapctl&sektion=8&format=html">swapctl(8)</a>, 
which made dealing with swap devices much easier. If you are on an OpenBSD 2.5 system, exchange swapctl
with swapon, and use pstat -s to list swap devices. Swapping to a file doesn't require a 
custom built kernel, although that can still be done, this faq will show you how to add 
swap space both ways.
</p>

<h3>Swapping to a file. </h3>

<p>
Swapping to a file is easiest and quickest way to get extra swap area's setup. This is not for users who
are currently using Softupdates. (Which isn't enabled by default).
To start out, you can see how much swap you are currently have and how much you are using with the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=swapctl&sektion=8&format=html">swapctl(8)</a>
utility. You can do this by using the command:
</p>

<ul><pre>
ericj@oshibana> <strong>swapctl -l</strong>
Device      512-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Priority
swap_device      65520        8    65512     0%    0
</pre></ul>

<p>
This shows the devices currently being used for swapping and their current statistics. In the above
example there is only one device named &quot;swap_device&quot;. This is the predefined area on disk that
is used for swapping. (Shows up as partition b when viewing disklabels) As you can also see in the above
example, that device isn't getting much use at the moment. But for the purposes of this document, we
will act as if an extra 32M is needed. 
</p>
<p>
The first step to setting up a file as a swap device is to create the file. It's best to do this with
the <a href="href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dd&sektion=1&format=html">dd(1)</a>
utility. Here is an example of creating the file <i>/var/swap</i> that is 32M large.
</p>

<ul><pre>
ericj@oshibana> <strong>sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swap bs=1k count=32768</strong>
32768+0 records in
32768+0 records out
33554432 bytes transferred in 20 secs (1677721 bytes/sec)
</ul></pre>

<p>
Once this has been done, we can turn on swapping to that device. Use the following command to turn on
swapping to this device
</p>

<ul><pre>
ericj@oshibana> <strong>sudo swapctl -a /var/swap</strong>
</ul></pre>

<p>
Now we need to check to see if it has been correctly added to the list of our swap devices.
</p>

<ul><pre>
ericj@oshibana> <strong>swapctl -l</strong>
Device      512-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Priority
swap_device      65520        8    65512     0%    0
/var/swap        65536        0    65536     0%    0
Total           131056        8   131048     0%
</ul></pre>

<p>
Now that the file is setup and swapping is being done, you need to add a line to your <i>/etc/fstab</i>
file so that this file is configured on the next boot time also. If this line is not added, your won't
have this swap device configured.
</p>

<ul><pre>
ericj@oshibana> <strong>cat /etc/fstab</strong>
/dev/wd0a / ffs rw 1 1
/var/swap /var/swap sw 0 0
</ul></pre>

<h3>Swapping via a vnode device</h3>

<p>
This is a more permenant solution to adding more swap space. To swap to a file permanently, first make a
kernel with vnd0c as swap. If you have wd0a as root filesystem, wd0b is the previous swap, use this line
in the kernel configuration file (refer to compiling a new kernel if in doubt): 
</p>

<ul><pre>
config          bsd     root on wd0a swap on wd0b and vnd0c dumps on wd0b
</ul></pre>

<p>
After this is done, the file which will be used for swapping needs to be created. You should do this by
using the same command as in the above examples.
</p>

<ul><pre>
ericj@oshibana> <strong>sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swap bs=1k count=32768</strong>
32768+0 records in
32768+0 records out
33554432 bytes transferred in 20 secs (1677721 bytes/sec)
</ul></pre>

<p>
Now your file is in place, you need to add the file to you <i>/etc/fstab</i>. Here is a sample line to
boot with this device as swap on boot.
</p>

<ul><pre>
ericj@oshibana> <strong>cat /etc/fstab</strong>
/dev/wd0a / ffs rw 1 1
/dev/vnd0c none swap sw 0 0 
</ul></pre>

<p>
At this point your computer needs to be rebooted so that the kernel changes can take place. Once this
has been done it's time to configure the device as swap. To do this you will use <a
href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=vnconfig&sektion=1&format=html">vnconfig(1)</a>.
</p>

<ul><pre>
ericj@oshibana> <strong>sudo vnconfig -c -v vnd0 /var/swap</strong>
vnd0: 33554432 bytes on /var/swap
</ul></pre>

<p>
Now for the last step, turning on swapping to that device. We will do this just like in the above
examples, using swapctl(8). Then we will check to see if it was correctly added to our list of swap
devices.
</p>

<ul><pre>
ericj@oshibana> <strong>sudo swapctl -a /dev/vnd0c</strong>
ericj@oshibana> <strong>swapctl -l</strong>
Device      512-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Priority
swap_device      65520        8    65512     0%    0
/dev/vnd0c       65536        0    65536     0%    0
Total           131056        8   131048     0%
</ul></pre>

<h2>14.5 - Soft-updates</h2>
</p>

<p>
<strong>
Softupdates are experimental and are NOT recomended for regular users.
</strong>
</p>

<p>
Over the last few years Kirk McKusick has been working on something called
"soft updates". This is based on an idea proposed by Greg Ganger and Yale
Patt that imposing a partial ordering on the buffer cache opertions would
permit the requirement for synchronous writing of directory entries to be
removed from the FFS code. Thus, a large performance increase of disk
writing performance.
</p>

<p>
To enable Softupdates your kernel must have option
</p>

<p>
<strong>option FFS_SOFTUPDATES</strong>
</p>

<p>
then you need to boot into single-user mode:
</p>

<ul>
<strong>
<pre>
        boot>boot -s
        [snip]
        bsd# tunefs -s enable &lt;raw device&gt;
        bsd# reboot -n
</pre>
</strong>
</ul>

<p>
GOOD LUCK. Please direct all problem reports with as MUCH information as
possible (kernel coredumps, tracebacks, etc) to <a href="mailto:csapuntz@openbsd.org">Costa</a>.

<h2>14.6 -  When I boot after installation of OpenBSD/i386, it stops at "Using partition 3 id 0".</h2>
</p>
<p>
This means that your MBR (Master Boot Record) was not installed properly
or that your BIOS' idea of the hard disk geometry is not compatible with
your current MBR. To solve this,
first try to reinstall the OpenBSD boot blocks. To do so use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&sektion=8&format=html">fdisk(8)</a> and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=installboot&sektion=8&format=html">installboot(8)</a>.
<P>
First, to get up and running, you will need to use your boot disk as a bootstrap.
After you put the install disk in, and before it loads the kernel and
ramdisk,
you get a <tt>boot&gt;</tt> prompt from the floppy disk.  Use it to boot OpenBSD off of your hard disk.
<UL><PRE>
booting...
OpenBSD boot 1.2.3
probing hd0 fd0...
boot> <b>boot hd0a:/bsd</b>
</UL></PRE>
Now that you are booted, and assuming you have dedicated your entire
hard disk to OpenBSD, re-initialize the Master Boot Record with fdisk(8).
(If you have partitions on your hard disk for operating systems other
then OpenBSD, you cannot use <tt>installboot</tt> anyways, you must look
at another option such as OS-BS, described below.)
<UL><PRE>
# <b>fdisk -i wd0</b>
</PRE></UL>
Now, you need to write the boot blocks again.
<UL><PRE>
# <strong>cp /usr/mdec/boot /boot</li></strong>
# <strong>/usr/mdec/installboot -v /boot /usr/mdec/biosboot wd0</li></strong>
</PRE></UL>
Finally, reboot and test it out.
<p>
If this doesn't work you still have a few more options. So, luck hasn't
run out yet. The first is to use a bootloader such as OS-BS. The OpenBSD
cd has the os-bs bootloader included in the tools directory. If you didn't
purchase a CD-ROM, you can download os-bs from any of the OpenBSD ftp
sites.  The file to grab is
<tt>pub/OpenBSD/2.5/tools/osbs135.exe</tt>
</p>

<p>
Also, take some time to look through the OS-BS web pages at
<a href= "http://www.prz.tu-berlin.de/~wolf/os-bs.html">
          http://www.prz.tu-berlin.de/~wolf/os-bs.html</a>
</p>

<p>
There are also other commercial bootloaders or lilo that you can use for
multi-booting.
</p>

<p>
Here is a simple outline of how to get lilo onto your system.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Boot a DOS floppy and do a fdisk /MBR. Make sure you do that on the
drive you'll be booting from.</li>
<li>Boot from a linux disk and install LILO & chain it to your OpenBSD
boot block.</li>
</ul>

<h2>14.7 - How do I get a dmesg from a boot floppy?</h2>
</p>
<p>
RAMDISK images (boot floppies) do not ship with the <i>dmesg</i> utility.
They do, however, have the <code>/kern</code> filesystem mounted. To copy 
the dmesg information to a file, do a:
</p>

<pre><ul>
# <strong>cat /kern/msgbuf >mydmesg</strong>
</pre></ul>
<P>
Boot disks also have 'more' to page through the output:
<pre><ul>
# <strong>more /kern/msgbuf</strong>

<h2>14.8 - Installing Bootblocks - i386 specific</h2>
</p>

<p>
Older versions of MS-DOS can only deal with disk geometries of 1024 cylinders
or less.  Since virtually all modern disks have more than 1024
cylinders, most SCSI BIOS chips (which come on the SCSI controller card)
and IDE BIOS (which is part of the rest of the PC BIOS)
have an option (sometimes the default) to "translate" the real disk
geometry into something that fits within MS-DOS' ability.
However, not all BIOS chips "translate" the geometry in
the same way.  If you change your BIOS (either with a new motherboard
or a new SCSI controller), and the new one uses a
different "translated" geometry, you will be unable to load the
second stage boot loader (and thus unable to load the kernel).
(This is because the first stage boot loader contains a list of the blocks
that comprise /boot in terms of the original "translated" geometry.)
If you are using IDE disks, and you make changes to your BIOS settings,
you can (unknowingly) change its translation also (most IDE BIOS offer 3 different
translations.) To fix your boot block so that you can boot normally,
just put a boot floppy in your hard drive, and at the boot prompt,
type "b hd0a:/bsd" to force it to boot from the first hard disk (and not the
floppy).  Your machine should come up normally.  You now need
to update the first stage boot loader to see the new geometry
(and re-write the boot block accordingly).
<br>
Our example will assume your boot disk is sd0 (but for IDE it would be wd0, etc..):
</p>
<ul>
<pre>
# <strong>cd /usr/mdec; ./installboot /boot biosboot sd0</strong>
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
If installboot complains that it is unable to read the BIOS geometry, at
the boot> prompt you may issue the &quot;machine diskinfo&quot; (or
&quot;ma di&quot; for short) command to print the information you need.
Feed the &quot;heads&quot; and &quot;secs&quot; values to installboot's -h
and -s flags, respectively, so that the modified installboot command is
the following:
</p>
<ul><pre>
#<strong> cd /usr/mdec; ./installboot -h &lt;heads&gt; -s &lt;secs&gt; /boot biosboot sd0</strong>
</pre></ul>

<p>
If a newer version of bootblocks are required, you will need to compile these yourself. To do so simply.
</p>

<ul><pre>
# <strong>cd /sys/arch/i386/stand/</strong>
# <strong>make && make install </strong>
# <strong>cd /usr/mdec; cp ./boot /boot</strong>
# <strong>./installboot /boot biosboot sd0</strong> (or whatever device your hard disk is)
</pre></ul>
