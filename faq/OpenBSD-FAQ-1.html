<H2><A NAME="non-std-hw"></A> <A NAME="s1">1. Non-standard hardware, my GENERIC or INSTALL kernel</A>won't boot OR "I can't get my hardware to work."</H2>

<P>My foobar 1230 SCSI adapter (or other peripheral) has a
non-standard irq and doesn't work with the <EM>GENERIC</EM> or
<EM>INSTALL</EM> kernels!</P>

<P>Yes it does. With a little tinkering and patience,
anything can be accomplished.  At the OpenBSD boot prompt type
"<CODE>-c</CODE>". IT should look something like this:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[OpenBSD boot Rev. 1.0a]
boot&gt;&gt; -c
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You will eventually get a '<CODE>UKC&gt;'</CODE> prompt. Here you can
type "<CODE>list</CODE>" and list all the devices that are compiled
into this kernel. Once you find the name of the device you'd
like to change, type "<CODE>change devicename</CODE>". <CODE>UKC</CODE> will
guide you through the different attributes of the device that
can be configured.  Once you are finished adding the necessary
configurations, you'll be back at the <CODE>UKC</CODE> prompt. At the
prompt type "<CODE>quit</CODE>" and your machine will continue to boot,
with the updated info.</P>
<P>In addition, other device drivers (sound cards, etc) that are
compiled into the kernel may conflict with other drivers. If
your kernel locks up during the boot process take note of the
device that it failed on. Try disabling that device, or the
one FOLLOWING it when you do your "list" at the '<CODE>UKC&gt;</CODE>'
prompt.</P>
