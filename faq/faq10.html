<h2>10.1 - Why does it say that I'm in the wrong group when I su to root?</h2>
</a>
</p>

<p>
With OpenBSD's <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=adduser&sektion=8&format=html">adduser(8)</a>
utility does not allow for you to add any users to the <kbd>&quot;wheel&quot;</kbd> group. This means that they must be added to
the <kbd>&quot;wheel&quot;</kbd> group by hand. This is done for security reasons, and you should be cautious with whom you give
access to. On OpenBSD, users who are in the <kbd>"wheel"</kbd> group are allowed to use the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=su&apropos=0&sektion=1&format=html">
su(1)</a> userland program to become root. Users who are not in <kbd>&quot;wheel&quot;</kbd> cannot use su(1). Here is
an example of a <kbd>/etc/group</kbd> entry to place the user <strong>ericj</strong> into the
<kbd>&quot;wheel&quot;</kbd> group.
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
<strong>wheel:*:0:root,ericj</strong>
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
If you are looking for a way to allow users limited access to superuser privliges, without putting them in the
<kbd>&quot;wheel&quot;</kbd> group, use <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sudo&sektion=8&format=html">sudo(8)</a>.

<h2>10.2 - How do I duplicate a filesystem?</h2>
</a>
</p>

<p>
To duplicate your filesystem use <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dump&sektion=8&format=html">dump(8)</a> and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=restore&sektion=8&format=html">restore(8)</a>. For example. To duplicate
everything under directory <kbd>SRC</kbd> to directory <kbd>DST</kbd>, do a:
</p>

<ul>
<strong>
<pre>
# cd /SRC; dump 0f - . | (cd /DST; restore -rf - )
</pre>
</strong>
</ul>
<p>
dump is designed to give you plenty of backup capabilities, and it may be an overkill
if you just want to duplicate a part of a (or an entire) filesystem.
The command <A 
HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tar&sektion=1&format=html">tar(1)</a>
may be faster for this operation.  The format looks very similar:
<UL>
<PRE>
# cd /SRC; tar cf - | (cd /DST; tar xpf - )
</UL>
</PRE>
<BR>

<h2>10.3 - How do I get httpd, sendmail, etc to startup with the
system?</h2>
</a>
</p>

<p>
OpenBSD uses rc-style startup to control starting applications with the
system. For common daemons you can simply edit 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/etc/rc.conf?rev=1.35">/etc/rc.conf</a>.
<br>
For example: To have ftpd started on boot change - 


<ul>
<strong>
<pre>
ftpd_flags=NO -- > ftpd_flags="-D"
</pre>
</strong>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
You can add any flags that you wish ftpd to start with.
</p>

<p>
If you have your own daemons that you want to be started, here is a
simple entry that you can put into /etc/rc.local.

<ul>
<strong>
<pre>
if [ -x /usr/local/sbin/mydaemon ]; then
        echo -n ' mydaemon';       /usr/local/sbin/mydaemon
fi
</pre>
</strong>
</ul>

Once in there, it will come up with the system each time.

<h2>10.4 - Why do users get relaying access denied when they are remotely sending mail through my OpenBSD system?</h2>
</a>
</p>

<p>
Try this:
</p>

<pre>
cat /etc/sendmail.cf | grep relay-domains
</pre>
<p>
The output may look something like this:
</p>

<pre>
FR-o /etc/mail/relay-domains
</pre>

<p>
If this file doesn't exist, create it.  You will need to enter the users
who are sending mail remotely with the following syntax:
</p>

<pre>
.domain.com    #Allow any <xyz>.domain.com user to send mail through us
sub.domain.com #Allow sub.domain.com to send mail through us
</pre>

<p>
Don't forget to:
</p>
<pre>
kill -1 `cat /var/run/sendmail.pid`
</pre>
<br>


<p>
<a name="10.5">
<h2>10.5 - I've set up POP, but users have trouble accessing mail thru POP. What can I do?</h2>
</a>
</p>

<p>
Most issues dealing with POP are problems with temporary files and lock files.
If your pop server sends an error message such as:
</p>
<pre>
-ERR Couldn't open temporary file, do you own it?
</pre>
<p>
Try setting up your permissions as such:
</p>
<pre>
permission in  /var
drwxrwxr-x   2 bin     mail     512 May 26 20:08 mail


permissions in  /var/mail
-rw-------   1 username   username        0 May 26 20:08 username
</pre>
<p>
Another thing to check is that the user actually owns their own /var/mail file.
Of course this should be the case (as in, /var/mail/joe should be owned by joe)
but if it isn't set correctly it could be the problem!
<P>
Of course, making /var/mail writeable by group mail opens up some vague and
obscure security problems.  It is likely that you will never have problems
with it.  But it could (especially if you are a high profile site, ISP,...)!
Try running cucipop or another POP daemon from the OpenBSD ports collection.
Or, you could just have the wrong options selected for your pop daemon
(like dot locking).  Or, you may just need to change the directory
that it locks in (although then the locking would only be valueable for the
POP daemon.)

<h2>10.6 - Setting up a Secure HTTP server with SSL(8)</h2>
</p>

<p>
This will take you through all the steps it takes to set up your own
Secure HTTP server. Since the OpenBSD 2.5 release, OpenBSD has shipped
with SSLeay. Because of patented RSA algorigthms, these cannot be
shipped with OpenBSD. libssl includes support for SSL version 2, SSL
version 3, and TLS version 1. So for now, because of patent
restictions, OpenBSD must ship without a fully-functional libssl. But it
is still completely useable. If you are able to use the RSA patented
libraries, you can easily upgrade your libssl with a command like this.
</p>
<p>
<kbd># pkg_add ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/${ver}/packages/${arch}/libssl-1.1.tgz </kbd>
<br>
Where ${ver} is the OpenBSD version number, and ${arch} is your
architecture.
</p>

<p>
The steps shown here are taken in part from the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssl&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">ssl(8)</a>
man page. Refer to it for further information. This FAQ entry
only outlines how to creating an RSA certificate for web servers, not a DSA
server certificate. To find out how to do so, please refer to the ssl(8)
man page.
</p>

<p>
Here is how you create your server key and certificate. These will go to
<strong>/etc/ssl/private/</strong>. To use the RSA features, you must have
upgraded your libssl. Now you can create your key.  Using ssleay,
</p>

<ul>
<strong># ssleay genrsa -out /etc/ssl/private/server.key 1024</strong>
</ul>

<p>
This will create a key of 1024 bits. Next you need to create a
<strong>Certificate Signing Request</strong> which is used to get a
<strong>CA</strong> or <strong>Certificate Authority</strong> to sign your
key. Here is the command to do so.
</p>

<ul>
<strong># ssleay req -new -key /etc/ssl/private/server.key -out /etc/ssl/private/server.csr</strong>
</ul>

<p>
You would now give /etc/ssl/private/server.csr to the <strong>CA</strong>
to get it signed. Or you could also sign the certificate for yourself.
Here is how you would do this.
</p>

<ul>
<strong># ssleay x509 -req -days 365 -in /etc/ssl/private/server.csr -signkey /etc/ssl/private/server.key -out /etc/ssl/server.crt</strong>
</ul>

<p>
This will sign your key, and it will be valid for up to 365 days. With
this done you can now start the httpd server. To start httpd(8) with ssl
you must start the daemon with the -DSSL flag. You can start this on boot
in <strong>/etc/rc.conf</strong> by changing the httpd line to look like
so:
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
httpd_flags="-DSSL"
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
This server will run on port 443.
</p>

<p>
<a name="10.7">
<h2>10.7 - I edited /etc/passwd, but the changes didn't seem to take place. Why?</h2>
</p>

<p>
If you edit /etc/passwd, your changes will be lost.  OpenBSD
generates /etc/passwd dynamically with <A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pwd_mkdb&sektion=8&apropos=0">pwd_mkdb(8)</a>.  The main password
file in OpenBSD is /etc/master.passwd.  According to pwd_mkdb(8),
<ul>
<pre>
FILES
     /etc/master.passwd  current password file
     /etc/passwd         a Version 7 format password file
     /etc/pwd.db         insecure password database file
     /etc/pwd.db.tmp     temporary file
     /etc/spwd.db        secure password database file
     /etc/spwd.db.tmp    temporary file
</pre>
</ul>
<P>
In a traditional Unix password file, such as /etc/passwd, everything
including the user's encrypted password is available to anyone on the
system (and is a prime target for programs such as Crack.)  4.4BSD
introduces the master.passwd file, which has an extended format (with
additional options beyond what was provided by /etc/passwd) and is only
readable by root.  For faster access to data, the library calls which
access this data normally read /etc/pwd.db and /etc/spwd.db.
<P>
OpenBSD does come with a tool with which you should edit your password file.
It is called vipw(8).  Vipw will use vi (or your favourite editor defined
per $EDITOR) to edit /etc/master.passwd.  After you are done editing, it will
re-create /etc/passwd, /etc/pwd.db, and /etc/spwd.db as per your changes.
Vipw also takes care of locking these files, so that if anyone else attempts
to change them at the same time, they will be denied access.

<h2>10.8 - What is the best way to add users? and delete them?</h2>
</p>

<p>
The best way to add a user in OpenBSD is to use the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=adduser&sektion=8&format=html">adduser(8)</a>
script. You can configure this to work however you like by editing
<strong>/etc/adduser.conf</strong>. You can add users by hand, but this is
the recommended way to addusers. adduser(8) allows for consistancy checks
on <strong>/etc/passwd</strong>, <strong>/etc/group</strong>, and shell
databases. It will create then entries for you, and HOME directory, and
even send a message to the user welcoming them. This can be changed to
meet your needs. For further instructions on adding users read the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=adduser_proc&sektion=8&format=html">adduser_proc(8)</a>
man page.
</p>

<p>
To delete users you should use the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rmuser&sektion=8&format=html">rmuser(8)</a>
utility. This will remove all existance of a user. It will remove any
crontab(1) entries, their HOME dir (if it is owned by the user), and their mail.
Of course it will also remove their <strong>/etc/passwd</strong> and <strong>/etc/group</strong>
entries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="10.9">
<h2>10.9 - How do i create an ftp-only account?</h2>
</p>
<p>
<p>
There are a few ways to do this, but a very common way to do such is to
add /bin/false into <strong>/etc/shells</strong>. Then when you create
the user set his shell to /bin/false, they will not be able log in
interactively, but will be able to use ftp capabilities. adduser(8)
will give them a home dir by default of /home/<user>. If this is what you
desire it doesn't need to be changed, however you can set this to whatever
directory you wish.

<h2>10.10 - Setting up Quotas</h2>
</p>

<p>
Quotas are used to limit users space that they have available to them on
your drives. It can be very helpful in situations where you have limited resources.
Quotas can be set in two different ways. 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>1 - User Quotas</li>
<li>2 - Group Quotas</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The first step to setting up quotas is to make sure that <strong>option
QUOTA</strong> is in your Kernel Configuration. This option is in the
GENERIC kernel. After this you need to mark in <strong>/etc/fstab</strong>
the filesystems which will have quotas enabled. The keywords
<strong>userquota</strong> and <strong>groupquota</strong> should be used
to mark each fs that you will be using quotas on. By default the files
<strong>quota.user</strong> and <strong>quota.group</strong> will be
created at the root of that filesystem to hold the quota information. This
default can be overwritten by doing, userquota=/var/quotas/quota.user. Or
whatever file you want to use for holding quota information. Here is an
example /etc/fstab that has one filesystem with userquotas enabled.
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
<strong>/dev/wd0a / ffs rw,userquota=/var/quotas/quota.user 1 1</strong>
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
Now it's time to set the user's quotas. To do so you use the utility
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=edquota&sektion=8&format=html">edquota(8)</a>
. A simple use is just <strong>edquota &lt user &gt</strong>. edquota(8)
will use vi(1) to edit the quotas unless the environmental variable
EDITOR is set to a different editor. For example:
</p>

<ul>
</pre>
<strong># edquota ericj</strong>
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
This will give you output similar to this:
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
<strong>
Quotas for user ericj:
/: blocks in use: 62, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)
	inodes in use: 25, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)
</strong>
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
To add limits, edit it to something similar to this:
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
<strong>
Quotas for user ericj:
/: blocks in use: 62, limits (soft = 1000, hard = 1050)
	inodes in use: 25, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)
</strong>
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
In this the softlimit is set to 1000 blocks and the hardlimit is set to
1050 blocks. A softlimit is a limit where the user is just warned when
they cross it and have until their grace period is up to get their disk
usage below their limit. Grace periods can be set by using the
<strong>-t</strong> option on edquota(8). After the grace period is over
the softlimit is handled as a hardlimit. This usually results in an
allocation failure.
</p>

<p>
Now that the quotas are set, you need to turn the quotas on. To do
this use <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=quotaon&sektion=8&format=html">quotaon(8)</a>.
For example:
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
<strong>
# quotaon -a
</strong>
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
This will go thru /etc/fstab to turn on the filesystems with quota
options. Now that quotas are up and running, you can view them by
the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=quota&sektion=1&format=html">quota(1)</a>.
Using a command of <strong>quota &lt; user &gt;</strong> will give that users
info. quota with no arguments will give your quota statistics. For
example:
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
<strong>
# quota ericj
</strong>
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
Will result in output similar to this:
</p>

<ul>
<strong>
<pre>
Disk quotas for user ericj (uid 1001): 
     Filesystem  blocks   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace
              /      62    1000    1050              27       0       0        
</pre>
</strong>
</ul>

<p>
By default quotas set in /etc/fstab will be started on boot. To turn them
of use <strong>quotaoff -a</strong>
