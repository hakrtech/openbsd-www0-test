<h2>12.1 - General hardware notes</h2>

<a name="GenPCI"></a>
<h3>12.1.1 - PCI devices</h3>

<ul>
<li>PCI devices are mostly self-configuring -- the computer and OS will
allocate resources to the cards as required.

<li>Interrupts can be shared on the PCI bus.  Not only can they be, the
system will often perform better when the IRQs are shared, especially on 
i386 systems.

<li>There are several different PCI bus standards.
You will occasionally find a PCI2.2 specification card that will just
not work in a PCI2.1 specification system.
Also, many cards with on-board bridges (such as, multi-port network
cards) will not work well in older systems.

<li>The PCI bus supports two levels of signaling, 3.3v and 5v.
Cards that work with 3.3v signaling have a second notch cut in their
PCI connector.
Most PCI cards use 5v signaling, which is used by most computers.
The Soekris single-board computers (Net45x1 and Net4801) are
commonly-encountered computers that only support 3.3v signaling.

</ul>

<a name="GenISA"></a>
<h3>12.1.2 - ISA devices</h3>
<ul>
<li>ISA devices cannot share resources, and in general, must be
manually configured to settings that don't conflict with other
devices in the system.

<li>Some ISA devices are "Plug and Play" 
(<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=isapnp&amp;sektion=4">isapnp(4)</a>)
-- if you have any problem with these devices, though, verify their
configuration in your
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dmesg&amp;sektion=8">dmesg(8)</a>, ISAPnP doesn't always work as desired.

<li>In general, if you have a choice, most people are best advised to avoid
ISA cards in favor of PCI.  ISA cards are more difficult to configure and 
have a much greater negative impact on the system's performance.
</ul>

<a name="GenNotConf"></a>
<h3>12.1.3 - My device is "recognized" but says "<tt>not
configured</tt>" in dmesg</h3>

In short, it means your device is not supported by the kernel you
are using, so you will not be able to use it.

<p>
PCI and many other types of devices offer identifying information
so that the OS can properly recognize and support devices.
Adding recognition is easy, adding support is often not.
Here is part of a dmesg with two examples of "not configured"
devices:

<blockquote><pre>
...
vendor "Intel", unknown product 0x5201 (class network subclass ethernet,
rev 0x03) at pci2 dev 9 function 1 not configured
...
"Intel EE Pro 100" rev 0x03 at pci2 dev 10 function 0 not configured
...
</pre></blockquote>

The first one (a network adapter) had its vendor code identified and the
general type of card was determined, but not the precise model of the
card.
The second example was another network adapter, this one a developer had
seen and had entered into the identification file that is
used to identify the card.
In both cases, however, the cards will be non-functional, as both are
shown as "<tt>not configured</tt>", meaning no driver has attached to
the card.

<h4>What can I do about a <tt>not configured</tt> device?</h4>
<ul>
<li>If the device or card you are seeing is not one you need, you can
safely ignore the "<tt>not configured</tt>" devices, they will not hurt
your system.
Some "special purpose" devices are deliberately left unconfigured so the
system's BIOS will handle them.

<li>In some cases, it is just a variation of an already supported
device, in which case, it may be relatively easy for a developer to add
support for the new card.
In other cases, it may be a totally unsupported chip set or
implementation (such as the above examples).
In that case, a new driver would have to be written, which may not even
be possible if the device is not fully documented.
You are certainly welcome to write a driver for the device yourself.

<li>If you are running an install kernel, the device may not be
supported by the install media you used, but may be supported by a
different boot disk.
This is a common with users of some popular SCSI cards who misread the
footnotes on the <a href="../i386.html">i386 platform page</a>
and try all the boot floppies their SCSI card is NOT supported on, 
rather than the one that it is supported on.

<li>If you are running a modified kernel, you may have removed support
for a device you now need.
In general, removing devices from a kernel is a
<a href="faq5.html#Why">bad idea</a>.
This is one reason why.

<li>Before reporting a "<tt>not configured</tt>" device, make sure you
have first tested the most recent
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">snapshot</a>, as support may already have
been added, and check the <a href="../mail.html">mail list archives</a>
to see if the issue has been discussed already.
Remember, however, if you are using an older version of OpenBSD, you
will generally have to upgrade to get the benefit of any new driver
written.
</ul>

<a name="GenSupport"></a>
<h3>12.1.4 - I have a card listed as "supported", but it doesn't
work!</h3>
Unfortunately, many manufacturers use product model numbers to indicate
marketplace position, rather than the technical nature of a product.
For this reason, you may buy a product with the same name or model
number as a product listed in the <a href="../plat.html">platform
pages</a>, but end up with a totally different product that may not work
with OpenBSD.
For example, many early wireless network adapters were based on the
Prism2 chip set, using the
(<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=wi&amp;sektion=4">wi(4)</a>)
driver, but later, when lower-cost chips became available, many
manufacturers changed their product to use chips for which no open
source drivers exist, but never changed their model numbers.
Wireless network adapters, unfortunately, are far from the only
example of this.

<a name="GenWireless"></a>
<h3>12.1.5 - What are my wireless networking options?</h3>
OpenBSD has support for a few wireless chipsets:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=awi&amp;sektion=4">awi(4)</a>
AMD 802.11 PCnet Mobile
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=an&amp;sektion=4">an(4)</a>
Aironet Communications 4500/4800
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=wi&amp;sektion=4">wi(4)</a>
Prism2/2.5/3
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=atw&amp;sektion=4">atw(4)</a>
ADMtek ADM8211
(<i>-current ONLY</i>)
</ul>

Adapters based on these chips can be used much like any other network
adapter to connect an OpenBSD system to an existing wireless network
(please see the manual pages for precise details).
The Prism2 and Prism3-based cards, however, can also be used in the
"Host-Based Access Point" mode, permitting them to be made into the
wireless access point for your network as part of your firewall.
Unfortunately, Prism2/3-based network adapters are no longer being
produced by most of the "mass market" manufacturers, as they have
switched to lower cost and newer chips, often
<a href="#GenSupport">without changing model number</a>.
Most of the manufacturers of newer chips have chosen to not release
documentation needed to produce free and open drivers for these 
devices (feel free to contact the manufacturers and ask them to 
change their policies).

<p>
Fortunately, Prism2/3-based adapters are still available through the
surplus and used market, and a few manufactures understand the value
of a properly documented, open-source friendly chipset, and continue to
produce professional-grade Prism-based adapters.
One reseller of these cards is
<a href="http://www.netgate.com">Netgate.com</a>.
In general, if a manufacturer does not explicitly identify a current
product as being Prism-based, you can safely assume it is not compatible
with the wi(4) driver.
Note that the newest Prism-series chips (such as the Prism-GT) are not
supported.

<p>
Another option to consider for using your OpenBSD-based firewall to
provide wireless access is to use a conventional NIC and an external
bridging Access Point.
This has the added advantage of letting you easily position the antenna
where it is most effective, which is often not directly on the back of
your firewall.

<h3>12.7.1 - ISA NICs</h3>
As OpenBSD runs well on older hardware, users often will end up using
ISA NICs on OpenBSD systems.
ISA hardware requires much more configuration and understanding than
does PCI hardware.
In general, you can't just stuff the card in the computer and expect it
to magically work.
In many machines, if your ISA device is not in a "Plug 'n' Play" (PNP)
mode, you must reserve the resources the card uses in the system's BIOS.

<h4>3Com 3C509B ep(4)</h4>
This is an excellent performing ISA NIC, supported by the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ep&amp;sektion=4">ep(4)</a>
driver.
The 'B' version can be distinguished from the non-B version by labeling
on the card and by the larger "main" chip on the board (approximately
2.5cm on a side for the 'B' version, vs. 2cm on a side on the older
version), and will provide better performance on a loaded or dual
network card system.
The 3C509B ships configured in a PNP mode, which unfortunately does not
comply with standards, and causes problems in OpenBSD's
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=isapnp&amp;sektion=4"
>isapnp(4)</a> support.
The adapter is picked up first as a non-PNP device, then again after the
PNP support comes on-line, resulting in an extra NIC showing in the
dmesg.
This may work fine, or it may cause other problems.  It is highly
recommended that the 3C509B cards have PNP mode disabled and manually
configured to non-conflicting settings using the 3Com DOS-based
configuration utilities before configuration.

<p>
The ep(4) driver will pick the cards up at any hardware combination that 
does not conflict with other devices in the system. 

<p>
If you have multiple 3C509 cards in your system, it is recommended that
you label the cards' spine with the MAC address, and use the dmesg to 
identify which is which. 

<p>
Note that the 3C509, the 3C905 and the 3C590 are often confused.
The 3C509 is a 10Mbps ISA card, the 3C905 and 3C590 are PCI
cards.


<p>
<h4>NE2000</h4>
The original NE2000 NIC was developed in the mid-1980s by Novell.
Since then, many manufacturers have produced cards that are very
similar, which are generally called NE2000-compatibles, or clones.
Performance of these clone cards varies greatly.
While some older NE2000-compatible cards performed very well, many of
the currently-available ones perform poorly.
NE2000-compatibles are supported by the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ne&amp;sektion=4">ne(4)</a>
driver in OpenBSD.

<p>
OpenBSD will handle some ISAPNP-capable NE2000-compatible cards well if
the ISAPNP mode is turned on.
Other cards will have to be set using either jumpers or a DOS-based
configuration utility.
Unfortunately, as the original NE2000 cards did not have software
configuration or ISAPNP support, there are no standards for this -- you
need the utility that will have been originally supplied with your
specific card.
This can often be difficult to obtain.

<p>
The ne(4) driver supports three configurations of the ISA NE2000 card
in the GENERIC OpenBSD kernel:
<pre>
     ne0:  port 0x240 irq 9
     ne1:  port 0x300 irq 10
     ne2:  port 0x280 irq 9
</pre>
If these settings are not acceptable, you can adjust them using
<a href="faq5.html#BootConfig">User Kernel Configuration (UKC)</a> or
by <a href="faq5.html">building a customized kernel</a>.

<p>
Note that the ne(4) driver is fairly "dumb" -- only the I/O port is
probed, if any of the above I/O addresses is detected, the corresponding 
IRQ is <i>assumed</i>.
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dmesg&amp;sektion=8">dmesg(8)</a>
will not reflect the actual IRQ of the adapter in the case of ISA ne(4)
drivers.
If this is not the actual IRQ your card is set to, it will not work.

<p>
Note that there are non-ISA cards that use the ne(4) driver -- PCI and
PCMCIA ne(4) cards exist. These notes do not apply to them, these
devices are auto-configuring.

<a name="FPU"></a>
<h3>12.7.2 - OpenBSD won't work on my 80386/80386SX/80486SX system!</h3>
<h4>80386sx</h4>
The 80386sx has a maximum addressing range of 16M, which is at the very
low end of OpenBSD/i386's support.
Most 80386sx systems can't support more than 8M of RAM, which places
them in the "For Experts Only" category, as some non-trivial steps and a
second computer are required to get going.
Also, see the next section:

<h4>80386</h4>

OpenBSD will run on an 80386 or 80386sx system IF it has a 80387 
or 80387sx hardware math coprocessor (Floating Point Unit, or FPU).
Unfortunately, these FPUs were not common, so many 80386 systems
will not have them.
OpenBSD will not run without the FPU on the i386 platform.
Again, be aware that this is a very small amount of processor for a
crypto-intensive operating system like OpenBSD.
You aren't likely to be happy with the performance of such a machine for
general use.

<h4>80486SX</h4>
The 80486SX chip was a "low-cost" version of the 80486, which lacked the
hardware floating point support (like the 80386) OpenBSD requires.
Fortunately, full 80486DX chips are fairly available, and is an easy
upgrade in most systems.

<a name="IrqShare"></a>
<h3>12.7.3 - My dmesg shows multiple devices sharing the same Interrupt
(IRQ)!</h3>
This is entirely acceptable, and in fact, even desirable for PCI
devices.
This is a design feature of the PCI bus.
Some people will say that sharing interrupt requests (IRQs) is bad,
however they are either confusing the situation with the ISA bus (where
IRQ sharing is not permitted), or past experience with broken hardware
or software.

<p>
ISA devices can not share IRQs.  If you find ISA devices sharing IRQs,
you must correct this problem.

<a name="i386USBkb"></a>
<h3>12.7.4 - How do I use a USB keyboard?</h3>
OpenBSD/i386 will usually use a USB keyboard and mouse without difficulty
after installation.
However, installing OpenBSD on a system with a USB keyboard can be
difficult, as the install kernels do not have the full complement of 
USB drivers required for complete USB keyboard support.  
As machines vary, you may need to experiment:
<ul>
<li>Some systems have a BIOS option for "Legacy USB support" or
something similar.
This allows the BIOS to emulate a traditional PS/2 keyboard.
If this is not enabled, you will <i>not</i> be able to enter commands
at the <tt>boot></tt> prompt.
However, some systems may run better with this feature turned on, some with
it turned off.
Some may install better with it in one setting and run better
with it in the other.
Some machines do not have this option.
<li>If you use "Legacy USB support", you may find it works better to
disable kernel USB support in
<a href="faq5.html#BootConfig">User Kernel Configuration (UKC)</a> by entering
"<tt>disable uhci</tt>" before completing boot.
<li>PS/2 keyboard/mouse-to-USB adapters may not work.
<li>You *may* find the system is more stable with the mouse disconnected
until the system is fully installed.
<li>In the worst case situation, you may find it easier to install 
OpenBSD on another computer, then move the hard disk to your "legacy-free"
machine.
</ul>

Once you have OpenBSD installed:
<ul>
<li>Using <a href="faq5.html#BootConfig">UKC</a>
to disable pckbd0 may result in less "kernel message noise" (usually,
<tt>pckdc: cmd failed</tt>), though if you do this, you will not be able
to use a PS/2 mouse.
<li>The USB keyboard and mouse are handled just like a PS/2 keyboard
and mouse by X.
Use "wscons" for your mouse driver.
<li>At the moment, there is no way to set up a serial console on a 
"legacy-free" (no serial, parallel or PS/2 port) system.
If you have difficulty with your system, you will have to record 
messages with pencil and paper.
</ul>

Unfortunately, there are a variety of ways in which USB is supported on PCs
right now, so you may have to do some experimenting with your system to get
the USB keyboard working properly.
Please contact <a href="mailto:faq@openbsd.og">faq@openbsd.org</a>
with any other well-documented USB keyboard tips you find.

<a name="i386smouse"></a>
<h3>12.7.5 - My keyboard/mouse keeps locking up (or goes crazy)!</h3>
This is most often seen when using a "switch box" to attach multiple 
computers to one keyboard, monitor and mouse.
You can experiment with different brand and design switch boxes, but
OpenBSD seems to be more sensitive to switching the mouse than some
other operating systems.
The problem is usually just the switching of the mouse.
If you are not using the mouse, the solution is simple:
don't attach the mouse cable to the computer.
If you are using the mouse, an easy solution is "one mouse per computer",
and switch just the keyboard and monitor.
If you just want console access to the machine, you
may wish to consider using a 
<a href="faq7.html#SerCon">serial console</a> instead.

<a name="i386WinModem"></a>
<h3>12.7.6 - Are WinModems supported?</h3>
WinModems are low-cost modems which rely on the processor to do much of
the signal processing normally done in hardware in a "real" modem.
Due to the variety of incompatible and typically undocumented WinModem
chips, there is no support for WinModems in OpenBSD, and this is not
likely to change.


<a name="mac68k"></a>
<h2>12.8 - Mac68k</h2>

<a name="mac68kSupport"></a>
<h3>12.8.1 - My Mac68k system doesn't seem to work!</h3>
Unfortunately, we have a small number of different Mac68k machines in
the hands of OpenBSD developers, and thus, only a few are known to work 
well at this moment.
If you can help restore support to currently broken systems, your code
would be welcome!

<a name= "mac68kTime"></a>
<h3>12.8.2 - Why is my Mac68k losing so much time?</h3>
This is caused by a hardware bug. OpenBSD uses clock interrupts to keep
track of the current time, but these interrupts have the lowest priority
in the <a href="../mac68k.html">Mac68k</a> architecture.
So, under heavy load, (such as disk or network activity) clock
interrupts will be lost and the Unix clock will not advance as it
should.
<a href="../macppc.html">MacPPC</a> systems do not have this
issue.

<p>
Mac OS gets around the time problem by always reading the hardware clock.
OpenBSD only reads the hardware clock at boot time and thereafter
ignores it. You may notice that, at shutdown, the kernel is not
confident enough to write the Unix time back into the hardware clock
because this time loss problem is well known.

<p>
A simple solution is to run rdate(8) on a
regular basis, by having a crontab entry for it.
Another good place to launch
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rdate&amp;sektion=8">rdate
(8)</a>
is in your <i>/etc/ppp/ppp.linkup</i> file if you are not permanently
connected and are a PPP user.

<a name="mac68k2disks"></a>
<h3>12.8.3 - My Mac68k system won't work with two disks</h3>
Yes, unfortunately, this is a known problem.
This usually shows itself by crashes shortly after the system goes
multi-user, and the crash may not be obviously related to the disk
system.
The solution is to only use one drive on your Mac68k systems.  A proper
fix would be welcomed!

<a name="mac68kInstCrash"></a>
<h3>12.8.4 - The installer crashed during install</h3>
The Mac68k installer running on Mac OS will not install files to a
"large" partition.  If any partition you are installing to is more than
around 500M in size, you can expect the following strange error:
<pre>
    Error on SCSIRead(), #5
    pos = 0, i = 22, fs = /
    alloccgblk: can't find blk in cyl
</pre>
The solution to this is to first install a minimal system in a "small" 
root partition, then boot OpenBSD and relocate things as desired.

<p>
So, let's say you want a 200M / partition. 
Create the root partition, create the other partitions you
want, newfs them all using the Mac OS utilities. 
Install etc34.tgz and base34.tgz to this / partition.

<p>
Mount your other partitions on a temporary mount point, and copy over
the directories you want to them, as demonstrated 
<a href="faq10.html#DupFS">here</a>.

<p>
Now, modify /etc/fstab, reboot, and unpack the rest of the *.tgz files as 
documented
<a href="faq4.html#AddFileSet">here</a>.

<p>
Following this process, any size can be achieved for the non-root
partitions.

<h2>12.9 - MacPPC</h2>

<a name="macppcbm"></a>
<h3>12.9.1 - Why is my bm(4) network adapter so slow?</h3>
The
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=bm&amp;sektion=4&amp;arch=macppc">bm</a>
driver, supporting the BMAC chip used on some MacPPC systems (including
