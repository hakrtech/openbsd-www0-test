<h1>12.0 - Performance Tuning</h1>

<a name= "12.1">
<h2>12.1 - Networking</h2>
</a>
</p>

<p>
If you run a busy server, gateway or firewall, you should make sure to prevent 
memory starvation to various parts of the kernel described below.
</p>

<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=options&apropos=0&sektion=4&format=html">options(4)</a> man page talks about the options presented.
<p>

<p>
An option you may need to change for a busy server, gateway or firewall is
NMBCLUSTERS.  This controls the size of the kernel mbuf cluster map.
On your computer, if you get messages like "mb_map full",
you need to increase this value.  If traffic on a networking interface stops
for no apparent reason, this may also be a sign that you need to increase
this value.  A reasonable value on the i386 port with most 100Mbps
ethernet interfaces (no matter how many the machine has) is 8192.  
</p>

<ul>
<strong>
option NMBCLUSTERS=8192<BR>
</strong>
</ul>
<br>

<p>
<a name= "12.2">
<h2>12.2 - Disk I/O</h2>
</a>
</p>

<p>
Disk I/O speed is a significant factor in the overall speed of your
computer.  It becomes increasingly important when your computer
is hosting a multi-user environment (users of all kinds, from those
who log-in interactively to those who see you as a file-server or a web-server.)
Data storage constantly needs attention, especially when your partitions run
out of space and when your disks fail.  OpenBSD has several options
to increase the speed of your disk operations and provide fault tolerance.
</p>

<H3>CCD</H3><UL>
<p>
The first option is the use of <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ccd&apropos=0&sektion=4&format=html">ccd(4)</a>, the Concatenated Disk Driver.
This allows you to join several partitions into one virtual disk (and thus,
you can make several disks look like one disk).  This concept is
similar to that of LVM (logical volume management), which is found in many commercial Unix flavors.
<P>
If you are running GENERIC, ccd is already enabled.  If not, you may
need to add it to your kernel configuration.
To start setup of ccd, you need to add support for it in your kernel. A
line such as:
</p>

<p>
<UL>
<pre>
<strong>pseudo-device   ccd     4       # concatenated disk devices</strong>
</pre>
</UL>
</p>

<p>
The above example gives you up to 4 ccd devices (virual disks).
Now you need to figure out what partitions on your real disks that you want
to dedicate to ccd.  Use disklabel to mark these partitions as type 'ccd'.
On some architectures, disklabel may not allow you to do this.  In this case,
mark them as 'ffs'.
<p>
If you are using ccd to gain performance by striping, note that you will
not get optimum performance unless you use the same model of disks with
the same disklabel settings.
<P>
Edit /etc/ccd.conf to look something like this:
(for more information on configuring ccd, look at
<A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ccdconfig&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">ccdconfig(8)</a>)
<UL>
<PRE>
# Configuration file for concatenated disk devices
#
# ccd   ileave  flags   component devices
ccd0   16      none    /dev/sd2e /dev/sd3e
</PRE></UL>
To make your changes take effect, run
<UL><PRE># ccdconfig -C
</PRE></UL>
As long as /etc/ccd.conf exists, ccd will automatically configure itself
upon boot.
Now, you have a new disk, ccd0, a combination of /dev/sd2e and /dev/sd3e.
Just use disklabel on it like you normally would to make the partition 
or partitions you want to use.  Again, don't use the 'c' partition as
an actual partition that you put stuff on.
Make sure your useable partitions are at least one cylinder off from the beginning
of the disk.
</p>
</UL>
<br>
<H3>RAID</H3>
<UL>
<p>
Another solution is <a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=raid&apropos=0&sektion=4&format=html">raid(4)</a>
which will have you use <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=raidctl&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">raidctl(8)</a>
to control your raid devices.  OpenBSD's RAID is based off of
Greg Oster's <A HREF="http://www.cs.usask.ca/staff/oster/raid.html">NetBSD port</a>
of the CMU
<A HREF="http://www.pdl.cs.cmu.edu/RAIDframe/">RAIDframe</a> software.
OpenBSD has support for RAID levels
of 0, 1, 4, and 5.<P> With raid, as with ccd, support must be in the KERNEL.
Unlike ccd, support for RAID is not found in GENERIC, it must be compiled 
into your kernel (RAID support adds some 500K to the size of an i386 kernel!)
</p>

<p>
<UL>
<pre>
<strong>pseudo-device   raid   4       # RAIDframe disk device</strong>
</pre>
</UL>
<P>
Setting up RAID on some operating systems is confusing and
painful to say the least.  Not so with RAIDframe.
Read the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=raid&apropos=0&sektion=4&format=html">raid(4)</a> and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=raidctl&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">raidctl(8)</a>
man pages to get the whole scoop, there are too many
options and possible configurations which are beyond the scope of this document.
</UL>
<BR>
<H3>Filesystem Buffer</H3>
<UL>
For fileservers with memory to spare, you can increase BUFCACHEPERCENT.
That is, what percentage of your RAM should you use as a file system buffer.
This option may change when the Unified Buffer Cache is completed
and is part of OpenBSD.  In the mean time, to increase BUFCACHEPERCENT,
you should add a line to your kernel configuration like this:
</p>

<p>
<UL>
<strong>option	BUFCACHEPERCENT=30</strong><BR>
</UL>
</p>
<p>
Of course you can make it as low as 5 percent (the default) or as high
as 50 percent (or more.)
</p>
</UL>
<br>
<H3>Soft updates</H3><UL>
Another tool that can be used to speed up your system is softupdates.  One of the 
slowest operations in the traditional BSD file system is updating metainfo
(which happens, among other times, when you create or delete files and
directories.) Softupdates
attempts to update metainfo in RAM instead of writing
to the hard disk each and every single metainfo update.  Another 
effect of this is that the metainfo on disk should always be complete,
although not always up to date.  So, a system crash should not require
fsck upon boot up, but simply a background version of fsck that makes
changes to the metainfo in RAM (a la softupdates).
This means rebooting a server is much faster, because you don't
have to wait for fsck!  (OpenBSD does not have this feature yet.) You can read
more about softupdates in the <a href="faq4.html#4.9">softupdates FAQ</a> entry.
If you use softupdates, you will most certainly want to take
advantage of the Tuning kmem section below.
</UL>
</p>
<BR>
<p>
<a name= "12.3">
<h2>12.3 - Tuning kmem</h2>
</a>
</p>

<P>
If you start using the performance tuning measures above, you may start
running out of kernel memory.  If you start getting
panics like "out of space in kmem_map" then you need to try
<UL>
<strong>
option NKMEMCLUSTERS=8192<BR>
</strong>
</UL>
Note that 8192 is valid for the i386 architecture, but may be too
little or too much for others. Look at /usr/include/machine/param.h
to see more information.
<P>
You may also want to increase the number of static kernel maps and entries.
The default value for these options is architecture dependant and is specified
in /sys/vm/vm_map.h. If you are using soft updates, the following values should 
keep you going!

<h2>12.4 - Hardware choices</h2>
</a>
</p>
<i>(Note- this section is heavily centered around the i386, or PC, architecture.
That is to say... other architectures don't give you quite as many choices!)</i>
<P>
The performance of your applications depends heavily on your OS and the
facilities it provides.  This 
may be part of the reason that you are using OpenBSD.
The performance of your applications also depends heavily on your hardware.
For many folks, the Price/Performance ratio of a brand new PC with
a Intel Pentium III or AMD Athlon processor is much better then the
Price/Performance ratio of a Sun UltraSparc 60!
And, the price of OpenBSD can't be beat.
<P>
If you are shopping for a new PC, whether you are buying it
piece by piece or completely pre-built, you want to make sure first
that you are buying reliable parts.  In the PC world, this is not easy.
<b>Bad or otherwise unreliable or mismatched parts can
make OpenBSD run poorly and crash often</b>.  The best advice
we can give is to be careful,
buy brands and parts that have been reviewed by an authority you trust.
Sometimes, when you skimp on the price of a PC, you lose in quality!
<P>
There are certain things that will help bring
out the maximum performance of your hardware:
<UL>
<LI>Use multiple disks.
<P>Instead of buying one 20GB disk, buy multiple 4GB or 9GB disks.  While this
may cost more, distributing the load over multiple spindles will decrease
the amount of time necessary to access data on the disks.  And, with more 
spindles, you will get more reliability and faster data access with RAID.
<p>
<LI>Use SCSI where you can.
<P>If you are building a server, and you need more then 10GB of disk space,
the SCSI architecture is the best choice.  IDE limits you to two disks per controller.
Wide SCSI limits you to 15 per controller!  While SCSI costs more, the flexibility and
performance can justify these costs.
IDE was not designed for use in a multi-user, multi-tasking environment.
<P>
<li>Use SDRAM.
<P>
This option applies mainly to PCs.  Most other architectures don't give
you a choice of what kind of RAM you can use.  Several PCs still do.
Avoid SIMMs, as there are not many companies manufacturing them anymore,
and in some cases they cost more then equivalent SDRAM!
<P>
<li>Use ECC or parity RAM.
<P>
Parity adds some functionality to see if the data in RAM has been
corrupted.  ECC extends this functionality and attempts to correct
some bit corruption errors on the fly.
This option applies mainly to PCs.  Most other architectures
simply require parity or ECC capable RAM.  Several non-PC computers won't
even boot with non-parity RAM. 
If you aren't using ECC/parity RAM, you may get data corruption and
other abnormalities. Several manufacturers
of "cheap PC RAM" don't even make an ECC variety!  This will help you
avoid them!  PC manufacturers often sell several product lines, 
divided around "servers" and "workstations."  The servers will incorporate
ECC RAM into their architecture.  Unix workstation manufacturers have been
using parity (and now ECC) for several years in all of their product lines.
<P>
<LI>Avoid ISA devices.
<P>
While most folks avoid ISA devices, because they are generally hard to configure
and out of date, there are still plenty in existence.  If you are using the ISA
bus for your disk or network controllers, (or even worse, for both) remember
that the ISA bus itself can be a performance bottleneck.  If you need speed,
look to PCI.  Of course, there are still several ISA bus cards that work
just fine.  Unfortunately, most of these are sound cards and serial port cards.
</ul>

<h2>12.5 - Enabling PCI IDE</h2>
</a>
<p>
If you have a current source tree that was last updated after July 18th, you
wil notice that OpenBSD has PCI-IDE code, a big win on performance
for anyone using IDE disks!  The PCI-IDE code introduces new PCI and ISA IDE
code, and both PCI and ISA versions have DMA (or Direct Memory Access) capability.
DMA allows the IDE controller to transfer data right from disk to your memory
instead of running it through the CPU.  This lowers the overall utilization
of your CPU,  keeping disk access fast and clean.
OpenBSD has implemented the pciide code from NetBSD.  The OpenBSD code
will attach <tt>atapiscsi* at wdc?</tt> and <tt>atapiscsi* at pciide?</tt>, which then allows you to attach <tt>scsibus* at atapiscsi?</tt>.
This means that can use the standard SCSI device drivers (sd, cd, st, ...)
for devices on the ATAPI bus!  (In NetBSD, the entire SCSI system was
revamped to include ATAPI support, OpenBSD makes ATAPI support
much more simple.)
<P>
Note that these instructions will change from time to time.  After this
code is sufficiently tested under OpenBSD, most of the steps below
will become unnecessary.  But for now, to use the PCI-IDE code (and anyone
who wants better performance out of their IDE-based system will want to!),
you need to change four files.

Subject: New ATA/IDE stuff in OpenBSD<BR>
<P>
This weekend, I started integrating the IDE code from NetBSD-current
to OpenBSD-current. It should be considered a work-in-progress.
<P>
I'm sending out this e-mail for three reasons: to tell you about the
new stuff, to ask for help in porting this across all the platforms
with IDE, and to ask for help in testing this new feature.
<P>
The code from NetBSD supports DMA, UltraDMA, PCI IDE, better error
recovery, etc. It's also faster too. The code has been extensively
tested in NetBSD but not in OpenBSD. The usual warnings apply: 
the new drivers might cause data loss.
<P>
The new code also has a different way of handling ATAPI devices (like
IDE CD ROMs, IDE tape drives, etc.). ATAPI devices talk the SCSI
packet protocol and the new ATAPI layer acts like a SCSI adapter. As
such, your ATAPI CD will now appear as SCSI CD (cd*), your ATAPI tape
drive as a SCSI tape drive (st*), your ATAPI zip drive like a SCSI
drive (sd*), etc. (note: some older ZIP drives are not ATAPI devices)
<P>
Many ATAPI devices are NOT entirely SCSI-I and SCSI-II compliant.  As
such, our SCSI device drivers may not work with your CD/tape drive/ZIP
drive. Integrating ATAPI device support into our SCSI devices is a
high priority so this shouldn't stay broken for long.  However, in the
interim, you might get SCSI errors to the console if you try to use
the devices. Under no condition should your machine hang or panic.  If
your machine does hang/panic, please send me mail, describing the
steps leading up to the hang and providing a dmesg dump.
<P>
For the best hard disk performance, you should not have an ATAPI
device on the same chain as a hard disk.
<P>
Currently, the ATA stuff is only integrated into the i386 port.  I am
willing to do the integration work on other platforms, but I need an
account on such a machine to do compiles and your help in testing the
resulting kernel.
<P>
To enable this feature on i386, you are going to have to edit some files.
Comments directing what edits to do appear in the following files:
<P>
1) arch/i386/conf/files.i386 (don't forget to uncomment pciide_machdep.c)<BR>
2) conf/files<BR>
3) dev/isa/files.isa<BR>
4) dev/pci/files.pci<BR>
<P>
In addition, look at
<P>
5) arch/i386/conf/NEWATA for how to configure the new stuff
<P>
If you boot the new stuff, I'd appreciate it if you sent me a dmesg dump.
Once you've got a new kernel, if anything goes wrong, please send me mail.
<P>
Feel free to provide positive feedback too. ;)
<P>
Thanks,<BR>
-Costa<BR>
</UL></tt>
<p>
You need to edit <tt>/usr/src/sys/dev/isa/files.isa</tt>,
find a section that looks like the excerpt below, and change it so that
the # symbols are not 'commenting out' the files which give you access
to the new code!
<ul>
<pre>
#Start uncommenting for new ATA stuff
# ISA "wd" (ESDI/IDE/etc.) controllers, ATAPI bus
attach wdc at isa with wdc_isa: isa_dma
file   dev/isa/wdc_isa.c                wdc_isa
#end uncommenting for new ATA stuff
 
#Start comment this out for new ATA stuff
#define       ata {drive = -1}
#device       wdc {drive = -1}: atapi, ata
#attach       wdc at isa with wdc_isa
#device       wd: disk
#attach       wd at wdc
#file dev/isa/wdc.c                   wdc & (wdc_isa | wdc_isapnp) needs-flag
#file dev/isa/wd.c                    wd needs-flag
#End comment this out for new ATA stuff
</pre>
</ul>
Next, you need to edit <tt>/usr/src/sys/dev/pci/files.pci</tt>, and change out this section to look like below:
<ul>
<pre>
#Start uncommenting for new ATA stuff
# PCI IDE controllers
device  pciide {[channel = -1]}: wdc_base, ata, atapi
attach  pciide at pci
file    dev/pci/pciide.c                pciide
#End uncommenting for new ATA stuff
</pre>
</ul>
Next, you need to edit <tt>/usr/src/sys/conf/files</tt>, and change it too.
<ul>
<pre>
#Start uncommenting for new ATA stuff
define  wdc_base
define  ata {[channel = -1], [drive = -1]}
define  atapi {[channel = -1]}
# Common code for ESDI/IDE/etc. controllers
device  wdc: ata, atapi, wdc_base
file    dev/ic/wdc.c wdc_base
#End uncommenting for new ATA stuff
</pre>
</ul>
Finally, PCI IDE has only been tested on the i386 platform as of this
writing.  If you are using another platform, you will need to do
some trickery to /usr/src/sys/arch/<i>yourarch</i>/conf/files.<i>yourarch</i>
(If you get this working on another arch, contact Costa and let him know!)
<p>
For i386 users, the trickery is in place, just uncomment it from
<tt>/usr/src/sys/arch/i386/conf/files.i386</tt>
<ul>
<pre>
#
# Machine-independent ATAPI drivers
# 

#Comment out this include below if you're using the new ATA stuff
#include "../../../dev/atapi/files.atapi"

#Start Uncomment for new ATA stuff
include "../../../dev/atapiscsi/files.atapiscsi"
include "../../../dev/ata/files.ata"
#End Uncomment for new ATA stuff
</pre>
</ul>
<P>
Once you edit all of these files, then cd /usr/src/sys/arch/i386/conf
and
<UL>
<PRE>
# <b>config NEWATA</b>
</PRE>
</ul>
and 
<ul>
<PRE>
# <b>cd ../compile/NEWATA</b>
# <b>make clean;make</b>
</pre>
</ul>
<P>
This will compile the NEWATA kernel.  If you are using another platform
with PCI IDE controllers, and you want to get this working, 
edit conf/files.<i>yourarch</i> to include the stuff shown above which
adds this capability to files.i386. Next, peek in the
/usr/src/sys/arch/i386/conf/NEWATA kernel config and 
copy out the new atapi/wd stuff to your own kernel config.
Note the commented out wd/atapi stuff in NEWATA,
and comment out the old wd/atapi stuff in your kernel the same way.
<P>
With this PCI IDE code, your chipset may not be known.  If so, you will
get a message like:
<UL>
<PRE>
pciide0: bus-master DMA support present, used without full driver support
</PRE>
</UL>
If you get this message, you can try and force DMA mode by
using 'flags 0x0001' on your pciide entry in your kernel config file.
That would look something like this:
<UL><PRE>
pciide* at pci ? dev ? function ? flags 0x0001
</PRE></ul>
After doing this, the pciide code will try to use DMA mode regardless of
whether or not it actually knows how to do so with your chipset.  If this 
works, and your system makes it through fsck and startup, it is likely
that this will work for good.  If this does not work, and the system hangs
or panics after booting, then you can't use DMA mode (yet, until support
is added for your chipset).  Note that if you find the documentation
for your PCI-IDE controller's chipset, this is a good start to fully
supporting your chipset within the PCI-IDE code.  You can look on the
manufacturer's website or call them.  If your PCI-IDE controller is part
of your motherboard, figure out who manufactures the chipset and pursue their
resources!
<P>
Note that you will know that DMA support has been enabled if you see this
message:
<UL><PRE>
pciide0:0:0: using DMA data transfers
</PRE></UL>
This means that pciide0, channel 0, drive 0 is using DMA data transfers.
