<h2>6.2 - Packet Filter (PF)</h2>
<!-- XXXrelease -->

<p>
The Packet Filter subsystem, which was introduced in OpenBSD 3.0,
performs two tasks: dealing with packet level forwarding permissions,
and mapping hosts/subnets to a range of external addresses.
The configuration file for this service is
<i><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf.conf&amp;sektion=5&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.3">/etc/pf.conf(5)</a></i>. 

<p>
(Note: in OpenBSD 3.0 and 3.1 there was an additional configuration file,
<i>/etc/nat.conf</i>.
Its functions are now incorporated into <i>/etc/pf.conf</i>.)

<p>
The
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf.conf&amp;sektion=5"><i>/etc/pf.conf(5)</i></a>
file has four parts:

<ul>
<li><b>Options:</b> Various options to control how PF works.
<li><b>Scrub:</b> Reprocessing packets to normalize and defragment
  them.
<li><b><a href="#NAT">NAT and Redirection Rules:</a></b> NAT allows many machines to access
  the Internet through one IP address.  Redirection allows incoming
  requests to be forwarded to a particular machine behind the NAT.
<li><b>Filter Rules:</b> Allows the selective filtering or blocking
  of packets as they pass through any of the interfaces.
</ul>

None of these sections are required to exist, but those that do must 
be in the above order.

<p>
To start these services with your system, you need to edit
<i><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rc.conf&amp;sektion=8">/etc/rc.conf(8)</a></i>
and set the line to:

<blockquote><pre>
pf=YES
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you are using NAT, you will most likely also need to set
the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sysctl&amp;sektion=8">sysctl(8)</a>
value <tt>net.inet.ip.forwarding</tt> to 1. You can do this by
uncommenting the relevant lines in 
<i><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sysctl.conf&amp;sektion=5">/etc/sysctl.conf(5)</a></i>
and rebooting your computer.

<p>
If you have Packet Filter compiled into your kernel, but you
don't have it turned on in your
<i><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rc.conf&amp;sektion=8">/etc/rc.conf(8)</a></i>
file, you can still activate it with the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pfctl&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.3">pfctl(8)</a> command.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf</b>
# <b>pfctl -e</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The first line sets up filtering and NAT, using <i>/etc/pf.conf</i> and
the second line activates PF.

<p>
This can also be combined into one command line:

<blockquote><pre>
# <strong>pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf -e</strong>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you make changes to <i>/etc/pf.conf</i> after 
PF is started, you can reload your rules by reloading the 
file:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This document will cover some basic 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf.conf&amp;sektion=5&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.3">pf.conf(5)</a>
configurations below.  You can also look at the <a href="#sample_pf.conf">resulting 
ruleset</a> that includes all the tweaks explained below in more detail.
You can find other Packet Filter information
at the <a href="http://www.benzedrine.cx/pf.html">Packet Filter web site</a> 
and in the 
<a href="http://www.inebriated.demon.nl/pf-howto/">Packet Filter HOWTO</a>. 

<p>
<h3>Packet Filter</h3>

<p>
In order to enable Packet Filter at boot, you will need to 
modify <i>/etc/rc.conf</i> so that it reads <tt>pf=YES</tt>.  Packet Filter (pf)
is controlled by <i>/etc/pf.conf</i>, which is read at boot. For a 
more detailed explanation, see 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf.conf&amp;sektion=5&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.3">pf.conf(5)</a>. 
In the examples that follow, <tt>fxp0</tt> will represent the external 
interface to the internet. It will be different for you, 
based on the ethernet adapter present in your computer. These 
rules will assume full-time internet connectivity, such as 
you would see on a webserver.

<p>
Packet Filter rules are processed sequentially from top to bottom; 
it helps to visualize each packet having to traverse every 
rule before it reaches its destination.

<p>
For example, the default ruleset provided allows all packets 
to travel in, and all packets to travel out:

<blockquote><pre>
pass out all 
pass in all
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This is shorthand, for:

<blockquote><pre>
pass in from any to any
pass out from any to any
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
which can be read as &quot;pass incoming packets from any source to 
any destination&quot;, with an implied &quot;on any interface (which is 
always implied if a specific interface isn't specified) of any
address family, <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inet&amp;sektion=4">inet (v4)</a> or <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inet6&amp;sektion=4">inet6 (v6)</a>&quot;.

<p>
Obviously, this isn't much of a filter.  More useful filtering
will be based on the address family (IPv4 or IPv6), protocol(s) 
and port(s) used by the services
you wish to filter.  Any of the protocols listed in
<i><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=protocols&amp;sektion=5">/etc/protocols(5)</a></i>
can be specified, by either name or number, but we will
concern ourselves with
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tcp&amp;sektion=4">tcp(4)</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=udp&amp;sektion=4">udp(4)</a> and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=icmp&amp;sektion=4">icmp(4)</a>.

<p>
Now let's say we don't want to allow any incoming IPv4 connections to 
TCP port 3306 (MySQL) because the database should only be connected 
to from localhost. Our ruleset would look like this:

<blockquote><pre>
pass out all
pass in all
block in on fxp0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 3306
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This says &quot;block in all IPv4 (inet) incoming packets, from 
any source to 
any destination bound for tcp port 3306.&quot;  Note that 
it is required that you specify a protocol with any port-based
filter, and recommended that you specify the address family.  
For services defined in the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=services&amp;sektion=5">/etc/services(5)</a>
file, you can also use the service names, such as <em>www</em>
or <em>mysql</em>.
A packet destined for tcp port 3306 on interface 
<tt>fxp0</tt> will pass the first &quot;pass in&quot; rule and then 
be dropped by the &quot;block 
in port 3306&quot; rule. If you reversed the order of our 
incoming rules (remember, order is important):

<blockquote><pre>
pass out all
block in on fxp0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 3306
pass in all
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Packets destined for tcp port 3306 would pass because the last rule 
in the set allows all packets to pass. It is important to keep 
this in mind when writing packet filter rules:
<b>The last matching rule wins</b>.

<p>
Of course, there are exceptions to every rule. The <em>quick</em> 
option drops the packet at the first rule that matches. Let's 
look at our above flawed example, if we add <em>quick</em> to 
the &quot;block in&quot; rule:

<blockquote><pre>
pass out all
block in quick on fxp0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 3306
pass in all
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
A packet destined for our host on tcp port 3306 will hit the 
&quot;block in quick&quot; rule and be dropped immediately. All 
packets destined for other ports or protocols won't find a rule match until 
they reach our &quot;pass in&quot; rule that allows all packets 
to pass.

<p>
<b>Default Deny</b>
<p>
The safest packet filtering policy is a default deny policy. 
All traffic not explicitly allowed is denied. This policy is far 
safer than explicitly denying each protected service, allows for 
smaller rulesets, and can protect from an accidentally 
misconfigured service that has been left exposed.

<p>
Let's now look at another example ruleset and explain 
things line by line. Here's an example for a webserver with a 
default deny policy that only allows ssh connections (for 
administration) and connections to http (port 80) and https 
(port 443).

<blockquote><pre>
block in on fxp0 all
pass  in on fxp0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 22
pass  in on fxp0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 80
pass  in on fxp0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 443
pass out on fxp0 all
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This will allow incoming connections from anywhere to tcp ports 
22(ssh), 80(http), and 443(https). It will drop all other 
connection attempts, and allow all outgoing connections. This 
is a pretty tight ruleset.  But what if you only wanted to 
allow internal hosts on your 1.1.1.0 address block to connect 
to ssh, but allow outside connections to http and https?

<blockquote><pre>
block in on fxp0 all
pass  in on fxp0 inet proto tcp from 1.1.1.0/24 to any port 22
pass  in on fxp0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 80
pass  in on fxp0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 443
pass out on fxp0 all
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Pretty good, but what if we only want to allow one machine 
(1.1.1.1) to administer the web server remotely?
In that case, we can change this:

<blockquote><pre>
pass  in on fxp0 inet proto tcp from 1.1.1.0/24 to any port 22
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
to this:

<blockquote><pre>
pass  in on fxp0 inet proto tcp from 1.1.1.1/32 to any port 22
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<b>Sample Rules</b>
<p>
Here are some good rules for everyone to use (assuming that 
fxp0 is the external internet-connected interface). First we 
will set up a simple address spoofing protection.  These addresses
shouldn't (normally) be floating around the Internet, 
and if they are, it is rarely good, so we block them:

<blockquote><pre>
block in quick on fxp0 inet from { 127.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, \
172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8 } to any
block out quick on fxp0 inet from any to { 127.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, \
172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8 }
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Our ruleset is starting to look pretty good; when we put 
it together, here is what it looks like:

<blockquote><pre>
# don't allow anyone to spoof non-routeable addresses
block in quick on fxp0 inet from { 127.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, \
172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8 } to any
block out quick on fxp0 inet from any to { 127.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, \
172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8 }

# only allow our administration machine to connect via ssh
pass in quick on fxp0 inet proto tcp from 1.1.1.1/32 to any port 22

# allow others to use http and https
pass in quick on fxp0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 80
pass in quick on fxp0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 443

# finally lock the rest down with a default deny
block in quick on fxp0 from any to any

# and let out-going traffic out
pass out on fxp0 from any to any
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<b>Packet Logging</b>
<p>
Now that's pretty good, but it could be better. What if we want to 
log any connection attempts to port 22(ssh) that get blocked by 
our firewall? Easy, Packet Filter can handle this with the <em>log</em> keyword:

<blockquote><pre>
pass in quick on fxp0 inet proto tcp from 1.1.1.1/32 to any port 22
block in log quick on fxp0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 22
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This rule will allow our remote administration machine to connect 
to port 22, but deny and log all other attempts to connect to 
port 22.

<p>
Logged packets are sent to the pflog0 interface, which is monitored
by 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pflogd&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.3">pflogd(8)</a>,
which typically dumps the packets to <i>/var/log/pflog</i> in 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tcpdump&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.3">tcpdump(8)</a>
binary format.  pflogd(8) is started by default by
<i><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rc&amp;sektion=8">/etc/rc(8)</a></i>
if pf is enabled in
<i><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rc.conf&amp;sektion=8">/etc/rc.conf(8)</a></i>.
You can read these log files using the following command:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>tcpdump -n -e -ttt -r /var/log/pflog</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
One should be aware that using tcpdump to watch the pflog file does 
NOT give a real-time display.  If you wish a real-time display, you 
can use this command:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>tcpdump -i pflog0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
One could also use tcpdump to narrow down the focus to facilitate
debugging:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>tcpdump -e -i pflog0 port 80</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Doing this does NOT impact the data that is put to the file 
<i>/var/log/pflog</i>.  

<p>
When examining one's logs, especial care should be taken
with tcpdump's verbose protocol decoding (activated via the -v command
line option).  Tcpdump's protocol decoders do not have a perfect
security history.  At least in theory, a delayed attack could be
possible via the partial packet payloads recorded by the logging
device.

<p>
Additional care should be taken about access to the logs.  Pflogd
will capture 96 bytes of the packet and log it.  Access to the logs
could provide partial access to sensitive packet payloads (like
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=telnet&amp;sektion=1">telnet(1)</a> or
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftp&amp;sektion=1">ftp(1)</a> logins).

<p>
<b>Packet Logging through syslog</b>
<p>
In many situations it is desirable to have the firewall logs available
in ASCII format and/or to send them to a remote logging server.
All this can be accomplished with 2 small shell scripts and with minor changes
of the OpenBSD configuration files.

<p>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=syslogd&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.3">Syslogd(8)</a>
is the standard daemon for logging, it logs in ASCII and is also able
to log to a remote logging server.

<p>
First we have to create a user <em>pflogger</em> with a .nologin. shell.
The easiest way to create this user is with
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=adduser&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.3">adduser(8)</a>.

<p>
After creating the user <em>pflogger</em> create the following two scripts:

<p>
<i>/etc/pflogrotate</i>

<blockquote><pre>
FILE=/home/pflogger/pflog5min.$(date "+%Y%m%d%H%M")
kill -ALRM $(cat /var/run/pflogd.pid)
if [ $(ls -l /var/log/pflog | cut -d " " -f 8) -gt 24 ]; then
        mv /var/log/pflog $FILE
        chown pflogger $FILE
        kill -HUP $(cat /var/run/pflogd.pid)
fi
</pre></blockquote>


<p>
<i>/home/pflogger/pfl2sysl</i>

<blockquote><pre>
#!/bin/sh
# feed rotated pflog file(s) to syslog
for logfile in /home/pflogger/pflog5min* ; do
        tcpdump -n -e -ttt -r $logfile | logger -t pf -p local0.info
        rm $logfile
done
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Edit the cron job for user <em>root</em>

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>crontab -u root -e</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
and add the following two lines:

<blockquote><pre>
# rotate pf log file every 5 minutes
0-59/5 *       *       *       *       /bin/sh /etc/pflogrotate
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Create a cron job for user <em>pflogger</em>

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>crontab -u pflogger -e</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
and add the following two lines:

<blockquote><pre>
# feed rotated pflog file(s) to syslog
0-59/5 *       *       *       *       /bin/sh /home/pflogger/pfl2sysl
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Add the following line to <i>/etc/syslog.conf</i>:

<blockquote><pre>
local0.info    /var/log/pflog.txt
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you want to log to a remote log server also add the line:

<blockquote><pre>
local0.info    @syslogger
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
and make sure host <i>syslogger</i> has been defined in the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=hosts&amp;sektion=5&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.3">
/etc/hosts(5)</a> file.

<p>
All logged packets are sent to <i>/var/log/pflog.txt</i>.
If the second line is added too they are sent to the remote logging host
<i>syslogger</i> as well.

<p>
<i>/etc/pflogrotate</i> now processes and then deletes <i>/var/log/pflog</i>
so rotation of <i>pflog</i> by
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=newsyslog&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.3">
newsyslogd(8)</a> is no longer necessary and it should be
disabled. However <i>/var/log/pflog.txt</i> replaces <i>/var/log/pflog</i> and rotation of it
should be activated.
Change <i>/etc/newsyslog.conf</i> as follows:

<blockquote><pre>
#/var/log/pflog        600     3       250     *       ZB      /var/run/pflogd.pid
/var/log/pflog.txt     600     7       *       24
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Pf will now log in ASCII to /var/log/pflog.txt. If so configured in
<em>/etc/syslog.conf</em> it will also log to a remote server.
The logging is not immediate but
it can take up to about 5-6 minutes (the cron job interval) before the logged
packets appear in the file.

<p>
<b>Multiple Protocols</b>
<p>
What if we need to allow connections to a service running 
over multiple protocols, such as bind, which uses TCP and UDP? 
Packet filter lets you lump options together into sets  
(more on this later): 

<blockquote><pre>
# Pass DNS traffic for BIND
pass in quick on fxp0 inet proto { tcp, udp } from any to any port 53
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Notice the spaces on both sides of the '{ }' characters.  This is 
neater than the alternative you might otherwise have to use:

<blockquote><pre>
pass in quick on fxp0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 53
pass in quick on fxp0 inet proto udp from any to any port 53
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<a name="normalization"></a>
<b> Packet Normalization</b>
<p> 
Packet Normalization means reassembling fragmented packets and clearing IP
options.
Some OSs and applications have trouble with abnormal or fragmented packets,
and it's in general good to have normalized packets for the filter rules to
look at and for the destination hosts to look at.
Thus, it is nearly always beneficial to normalize the
packets before they are passed on to their ultimate destination.
This is done with the <b>scrub</b> directive, used as here:

<blockquote><pre>
scrub in all
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This does put a very minor additional load on the system, and requires a bit of
memory to cache the packet fragments. The advantages of packet normalization
almost always outweigh this cost.

<p>
<b>IP Options</b>
<p>
By default, PF blocks packets with IP options set.  This can make
the job more difficult for &quot;OS fingerprinting&quot; utilities
like nmap.  If you have an application that requires the passing of 
these packets, such as multicast or IGMP, you can use the 
<b>allow-opts</b>
directive:

<blockquote><pre>
pass in quick on fxp0 all allow-opts
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<b>TCP Flags, established connections and keeping state</b>
<p>
Packet Filter can also filter packets based on TCP flags and 
maintain established connections and connection state. It is 
recommend that all users who wish to filter packets based on 
TCP flags understand what role each flag plays. For instance, 
if you wanted to deny all packets with the FIN, URG, and PSH 
flags set (like for instance an nmap OS fingerprinting attempt) 
you could use a rule like this:

<blockquote><pre>
block in quick on fxp0 inet proto tcp from any to any flags FUP/FUP
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
(Thanks to <a href="mailto:halogen@nol.net">Kyle Hargraves</a> for that tip)

<p>
Packet Filter's next cool trick is its ability to maintain state. 
Maintaining state has been described as &quot;not speaking until 
spoken to&quot;; in other words, once a connection is established, 
packets no longer have to traverse rulesets. This is a very 
powerful feature allowing much simpler and more secure rule 
writing.

<p>
For example, let's see how we can apply state to our previous 
example ruleset (confused yet?). To review, we are allowing 
management access from our Class C to port 22(ssh) and allowing 
all incoming web traffic on ports 80(http) and 443(https). We 
are blocking all other traffic. But, what if I want to
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&amp;sektion=1">ssh(1)</a>
out of the webserver? What if I need to use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=lynx&amp;sektion=1">lynx(1)</a> to look up 
something in the FAQ? Well, I can't because I have blocked all 
incoming connections other than those on the specified ports. While 
this is the safest route, it can be quite inconvenient. By 
adding the <em>keep state</em> keywords to our &quot;pass 
out&quot; rule, we can automatically allow incoming 
packets in response to connections we initiate, such as 
when web browsing.  Remember, we do need to specify what 
protocol we are keeping state for.

<blockquote><pre>
block in  on fxp0 inet proto tcp all
pass  in  on fxp0 inet proto tcp from 1.1.1.0/24 to any port 22 keep state
pass  in  on fxp0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 keep state
pass  in  on fxp0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 443 keep state
pass  out on fxp0 inet proto tcp all keep state
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This little change will dramatically increase the flexibility and
security of our ruleset: for instance, in the above ruleset, we are
allowing all tcp traffic into ports 80 &amp; 443. We can tighten this up
even more. In order for a tcp connection to be established, we only need
to allow the initial handshake to occur; once that occurs, we can block
traffic to that port and allow our &quot;keep state&quot; rule to manage
the connection. To allow the initial handshake to complete, we need only
allow packets with the SYN flag set and ACK flag not set. By passing only 
packets with SYN set, we can prevent many forms of portscanning such
as FIN scanning. flags S/SA means: out of flags S (SYN) and A (ACK), only
SYN may be set. Other flags aren't investigated.
The rules now look like this:

<blockquote><pre>
block in  on fxp0 inet proto tcp all
pass  in  on fxp0 inet proto tcp from 1.1.1.0/24 to any port 22 \
	flags S/SA keep state
pass  in  on fxp0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 \
	flags S/SA keep state
pass  in  on fxp0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 443 \
	flags S/SA keep state
block out on fxp0 inet proto tcp all
pass  out on fxp0 inet proto tcp all flags S/SA keep state
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Let's start to tie things together by putting all of the rules we 
have so far into a ruleset. This ruleset will support IPv4, have 
a default deny policy, allow management connections from an 
internal network only (via ssh) and allow incoming traffic on 
ports 80(http) and 443(https). It will also protect against 
spoofed non-routeable ip addresses, and drop all packets that are 
too fragmented to inspect. A pretty comprehensive setup for a public 
webserver. Here's what <i>/etc/pf.conf</i> could look like:

<blockquote><pre>
# Clean up fragmented and abnormal packets
scrub in all

# don't allow anyone to spoof non-routeable addresses
block in quick on fxp0 inet from { 127.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, \
172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8 } to any
block out quick on fxp0 inet from any to { 127.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, \
172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8 }

# by default, block all incoming packets, except those explicitly
# allowed by further rules
block in on fxp0 all

# allow others to use http and https
pass in on fxp0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 \
	flags S/SA keep state
pass in on fxp0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 443 \
	flags S/SA keep state

# and let out-going traffic out and maintain state on established connections
# pass out all protocols, including TCP, UDP and ICMP, and create state,
# so that external DNS servers can reply to our own DNS requests (UDP).
block out on fxp0                 all
pass  out on fxp0 inet proto tcp  all flags S/SA keep state
pass  out on fxp0 inet proto udp  all            keep state
pass  out on fxp0 inet proto icmp all            keep state
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
While this may look good, there are some things Packet Filter 
will let you do to make your <i>pf.conf</i> file look neater and easier
to maintain.

<p>
<b>Sets</b>
<p>
Sets are useful "shortcuts" for writing simple and clear 
rules in PF.  For example, what if we need to allow 
connections to a service running
over multiple protocols, such as BIND, which uses TCP and UDP?

<blockquote><pre>
pass in quick on fxp0 inet proto { tcp, udp } from any to any port 53
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Note the spaces on both sides of the '{ }' characters. 

<p>
Groups of related IPs can be clustered together into sets, which 
can be used anywhere a single IP could be used.  For example, 
looking at our anti-spoofing rules above:

<blockquote><pre>
# don't allow anyone to spoof non-routeable addresses
block in quick on fxp0 inet from { 127.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, \
172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8 } to any
block out quick on fxp0 inet from any to { 127.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, \
172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8 }
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<b>Variable Expansion</b>
<p>
One problem with the above sample <i>pf.conf</i> file is that should
you need to change your NIC, or change an IP address, you would
need to change a number of lines.  This can be lessened by using
variable expansion:

<blockquote><pre>
NoRouteIPs="{ 127.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8 }"
ExtIF="fxp0"
block in quick on $ExtIF from $NoRouteIPs to any
block out quick on $ExtIF from any to $NoRouteIPs
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<a name="sample_pf.conf"></a>
<b>Putting it all together</b>
<p>
Now, let's put it all together, and look at the elegance of the file:

<blockquote><pre>
# Define useful variables
ExtIF="fxp0"              # External Interface
IntNet="1.1.1.0/24"       # Our internal network
NoRouteIPs="{ 127.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8 }"
Services="{ www, https }"

# Clean up fragmented and abnormal packets
scrub in all

# don't allow anyone to spoof non-routeable addresses
block in  quick on $ExtIF from $NoRouteIPs to any
block out quick on $ExtIF from any to $NoRouteIPs

# by default, block all incoming packets, except those explicitly
# allowed by further rules
block in on $ExtIF all

# allow others to use http and https
pass  in on $ExtIF inet proto tcp from any to any port $Services \
	flags S/SA keep state

# and let out-going traffic out and maintain state on established connections
# pass out all protocols, including TCP, UDP and ICMP, and create state,
# so that external DNS servers can reply to our own DNS requests (UDP).
block out on $ExtIF                 all
pass  out on $ExtIF inet proto tcp  all flags S/SA keep state
pass  out on $ExtIF inet proto udp  all            keep state
pass  out on $ExtIF inet proto icmp all            keep state
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you experience problems, you may want to enable logging on 
individual rules to effectively troubleshoot. ie: 

<blockquote><pre>
pass in log quick on fxp0 proto tcp from 1.1.1.0/24 to any port 22
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pflogd&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.3">pflogd(8)</a> will write the ip log entries to <i>/var/log/pflog</i>.
Remember that <i>/var/log/pflog</i> is a binary file, intended to be
read by <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tcpdump&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.3">tcpdump(8)</a>, NOT directly by humans.

<p>
When you modify the configuration file to log packets, don't 
forget to <b>pfctl -R /etc/pf.conf</b> for the changes to take effect!

<h3><u>6.3.1 NAT Introduction</u></h3>

<a name="nat1.1"></a>

<p>
Based on 
<a href="http://www.geektools.com/rfc/rfc1631.txt">RFC 1631</a>, 
NAT provides an easy way to map internal networks to a single 
routeable ("real") internet address. This is very useful if you 
don't have officially assigned addresses for every host on your 
internal network. When you set up private/internal networks, you 
can take advantage of reserved address blocks (assigned in 
<a href="http://www.geektools.com/rfc/rfc1918.txt">RFC 1918</a>), 
such as:

<p>
10.0.0.0/8 (10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255)<br>
172.16.0.0/12 (172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255)<br>
192.168.0.0/16 (192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255)

<p>
The user is assumed to have already set up
and configured an OpenBSD machine with two network cards (one
connected to the Internet and the other to the local network).

<p>
<a name="nat1.3"></a>
<b>Configuration</b>

<p>
For the purpose of example, we will use the system described
below. Your setup will almost certainly vary from this, so be 
very careful in typing anything you see here literally into
your system and expecting it to work as you desire.  

<blockquote>
<b>NICs: </b>
<pre>
Intel EtherExpress Pro/100 <b>fxp0</b>
Connected to the EXTERNAL LAN (or WAN)
<b>IP Address: </b>24.5.0.5
<b>Netmask: </b>255.255.255.0

Compaq Netelligent 10/100Mb <b>tl0</b>
Connected to the INTERNAL LAN
<b>IP Address: </b>192.168.1.1
<b>Netmask: </b>255.255.255.0
</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>External, Internet-routeable IP (provided by ISP, in this example, a cable modem provider)<br></b>
<pre>
<b>IP Address: </b>24.5.0.5
<b>Netmask: </b>255.255.255.0
<b>Gateway: </b>24.5.0.1
</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Local Area Network</b><br>
In this example environment,
machines on the internal network use the IP addressing scheme 192.168.1.xxx
(where xxx is a unique number). There could be a variety of different
operating systems on the internal network, such as Windows 98,
Windows NT, OpenBSD and Linux, but the client OS is not an issue for NAT. 
For the examples, the client we will look at on the internal
network will be assumed to have an IP address of 192.168.1.40.
</blockquote>

<h3><u>6.3.2 Network Address Translation</u></h3>

<p>
<a name="nat2.1"></a>
<b>Introduction to NAT</b>

<p>
Each node on the Internet requires a unique IP address.  At least
with IPv4, there is a very finite number of distinct IP addresses 
available, and as a result, they are not free.  Most "low-cost" ISPs
will limit a site to anywhere from 1 to 30 addresses, and while 
larger budget organizations may be able to afford a larger block, 
in most cases, there are relatively few benefits and considerable 
risks to having each computer individually addressable on the 
Internet.

<p>
Network Address Translation, or NAT, (also known as &quot;IP Masquerading&quot;
if you are coming from a Linux background) allows multiple computers
to be located &quot;behind&quot; one (or a small number of) IP address.  Each 
&quot;internal&quot; computer has a locally assigned, unregistered
IP address (per <a href="http://www.geektools.com/rfc/rfc1918.txt">RFC 1918</a>), 
and all utilize the same external IP address, simultaneously.  

<p>
The way NAT works is rather simple. When a client on the LAN
wants to connect to a machine on the Internet, it sends out a TCP
packet with a request to connect. Inside the TCP packet header is the
client's IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.40) and the requested host's IP
address (e.g. 123.45.67.89). The machine running NAT intercepts this
TCP packet and changes the client's IP address from 192.168.1.40 to
the IP address of the Internet-connected machine (e.g. 24.5.0.5). This
effectively tricks the host machine into thinking the actual connection
is from the NAT machine, not the actual client's machine. The host then
sends back responses to the NAT machine like it was the one connecting.
When the NAT machine receives the responses it quickly translates the
destination IP address back from itself to the client's machine and
sends the packet to the client. The client normally does not have any 
idea what happened and the apparent Internet connectivity is 
transparent to the user and user's applications.

<p>
The example below shows NAT a little more clearly:

<blockquote><pre>
Client ----------------- tl0 [ NAT ] fxp0 ---------- Internet Host
192.168.1.40 --- 192.168.1.1 [ NAT ] 24.5.0.5 --- 123.45.67.89

OUTGOING TCP Packet                     OUTGOING TCP Packet
From: 192.168.1.40  &gt;&gt;=== NAT ===&gt;&gt;     From: 24.5.0.5
To: 123.45.67.89                        To: 123.45.67.89

INCOMING TCP Packet                     INCOMING TCP Packet
From: 123.45.67.89 			From: 123.45.67.89
To:   192.168.1.40  &lt;&lt;=== NAT ===&lt;&lt;     To: 24.5.0.5
</pre></blockquote>

<b>Why use NAT?</b>

<p>
When presented with a cable modem in my new apartment I was also
presented with another minor problem. How to get Internet access for
my roommates, when the cable modem resides in my room? There were a
few options I could implement, ranging from obtaining extra IP
addresses, to setting up a proxy server, to setting up NAT.
(Don't let the home cable modem example fool you.  NAT is powerful enough
to masquerade a large network with hundreds or even thousands of computers!)

<p>
There are many reasons why I wanted to set up NAT. The number one
reason is to save money. There
are two roommates in my house; splitting the cost is certainly attractive.
Further, as each roommate has their own PC and I have three, we
had five computers to connect, but my ISP only allows for three IP 
addresses per household.  This means that there weren't enough IP 
addresses to allow every machine simultaneous direct Internet access.

<p>
By using NAT each machine will have a unique internal IP address
but share the one IP address given to me by my ISP. The cost goes down.

<p>
<a name="nat2.4"></a>
<b>Setup</b>

<p>
In order to enable NAT on your OpenBSD machine you will need to turn on
PF. This is easily accomplished by editing the files listed
below (make the changes to the file so it looks like the options below):

<p>
<b>/etc/rc.conf</b> (this file used to start services at boot time)

<blockquote><pre>
pf=YES<br>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<b>/etc/sysctl.conf</b>

<blockquote><pre>
net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
After these changes are made, the machine is now ready for the
configuration of NAT.

<p>
<a name="nat2.5"></a>
<b>Configuration</b>

<p>
The first step is to configure the PF configuration file
(<i><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf.conf&amp;sektion=5&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.3">/etc/pf.conf</a></i>).
For the purposes of this document we will allow traffic to pass
through this firewall without any interference. The file
should look like this:

<blockquote><pre>
pass in all
pass out all
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Again, for more information you can read <a href="#PF">FAQ 6, Packet Filter</a>

<p>
The NAT portion of the PF configuration file
(<i><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=nat.conf&amp;sektion=5&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.3">/etc/pf.conf</a></i>)
has a very simple syntax.
For the configuration set forth above, the file should contain the
following entry:

<blockquote><pre>
nat on fxp0 from 192.168.1.0/24 to any -&gt; 24.5.0.5
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Here is an explanation for the above lines.

<dl>
<dt>"nat"
<dd>This indicates the command you are giving is a NAT rule.
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>"fxp0"
<dd>This is the network interface that is connected to the Internet.
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>"192.168.1.0/24"
<dd>the IP address and netmask (the netmask is in
CIDR format). Combined they state "any IP address of value
192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.254" should be mapped. 
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>"24.5.0.5"
<dd>This is the external IP address the internal IP addresses will be mapped to.
</dl>

<p>
<a name="nat2.6"></a>
<b>Running</b>

<p>
Once the configuration is
complete, there are two ways to enable NAT. The first (and best way if
possible) is to reboot your OpenBSD machine.
This is accomplished with the command "<i>reboot</i>". 

<p>
If you would like to configure NAT from the command line, use the following
commands:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf</b>
# <b>pfctl -e</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The first line is to load a set of NAT rules into PF (and flushing any
old rules); the second line enables PF.  Again, though, rebooting is
the best way to ensure that everything will startup from a reboot as 
you expect.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> in order to reload the NAT settings (in case you edit the file
but don't want to reboot) just execute the first command over again. The
settings will be flushed and reloaded.

<p>
<a name="nat3.0"></a>
<h3><u>6.3.3 Nat Knowledge Base</u></h3>

<p>
<a name="nat3.1"></a>
<b>Checking NAT Status</b>

<p>
To find out how NAT is doing or make sure the settings have taken
effect, you use the "-ss" option. This option will list all the
current sessions that NAT is running:

<blockquote><pre>
# pfctl -ss
TCP  192.168.1.40:2132 -&gt; 24.5.0.5:53136 -&gt; 65.42.33.245:22       TIME_WAIT:TIME_WAIT
TCP  192.168.1.40:2492 -&gt; 24.5.0.5:55011 -&gt; 65.42.33.245:22       ESTABLISHED:ESTABLISHED
UDP  192.168.1.40:2491 -&gt; 24.5.0.5:60527 -&gt; 24.2.68.33:53       2:1
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Explanations (first line, others are similar):

<dl>
<dt>"192.168.1.40:2132"
<dd>This tells you the IP address of the
machine on the LAN that is using NAT (192.168.1.40). The port number used to make
the connection (2132) is displayed afterwards.
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>"24.5.0.5:53136"
<dd>This denotes that the connection is going
to the Internet via IP address 24.5.0.5 and using port 53136.
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>"65.42.33.245:22"
<dd>The IP address and the port being connected to.
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>"TIME_WAIT:TIME_WAIT"
<dd>This indicates what state PF believes the TCP connection to be in.
</dl>

<p>
<a name="nat3.2"></a>
<b>Issues with FTP and NAT</b>

<p>
There are a few limitations of NAT; the most commonly encountered is
with FTP. You can use FTP in two ways: passive and active. Of these,
passive FTP is generally considered more secure.

<p>
With active FTP, when a user connects to a remote FTP server and
requests information or a file, the FTP client sends the server a random
port number that the FTP server will make a connection to on the
client and transfer the info. This is a problem for users attempting
to gain access to FTP servers from within the LAN. When the FTP server
sends its information it sends it to the external NIC at a random port.
The NAT machine will receive this, but because it has no mappings for
the unknown packet and doesn't have any mappings for that port, it will
drop the packet and won't deliver it.

<p>
With passive mode FTP (the default with OpenBSD <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftp&amp;sektion=1">ftp(1)</a>
client), the client requests that the server picks up a random port
that it will listen on for the data connection. The server informs the
client of the port it has chosen, and the client connects to this port
to transfer the data. Unfortunately, this is not always possible or
desirable. ftp(1) uses this mode by default; to force active mode FTP,
use the -A flag to ftp, or set the passive mode to off by issuing
the command

<blockquote><pre>
passive off
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
at the ftp&gt; prompt.

<p>
Packet Filter provides another solution for this situation, redirecting 
FTP traffic through an FTP proxy server, a process which acts to "guide" your 
FTP traffic through the filters.  The FTP proxy used by OpenBSD and PF is 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftp-proxy&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.3">ftp-proxy(8)</a>.
To activate it, put something like this in your <i>/etc/pf.conf</i> file:

<blockquote><pre>
rdr on tl0 proto tcp from any to any port 21 -&gt; 127.0.0.1 port 8021
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Short explanation of this line is, "TCP port 21 traffic on the internal
interface is redirected to the proxy server running on this machine
which is listening at port 8021".

<p>
Hopefully, it is apparent the proxy server has to be started and running on 
the OpenBSD box; this is done by inserting the following line in
<i>/etc/inetd.conf</i>:

<blockquote><pre>
127.0.0.1:8021 stream tcp nowait root /usr/libexec/ftp-proxy ftp-proxy
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
and either rebooting the system or sending a 'HUP' signal to
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;sektion=8">inetd(8)</a>.
One way to send the 'HUP' signal is with the command:

<blockquote><pre>
kill -HUP `cat /var/run/inetd.pid`
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
You will note that ftp-proxy is listening on port 8021, the same port the above 
rdr statement was sending FTP traffic to.  The choice of port 8021 is arbitrary,
though 8021 is a good choice, as it is not defined for any other application.

<p>
<a name="nat3.3"></a>
<b>Redirecting Traffic</b>

<p>
For some applications, you may need to redirect incoming or outgoing 
traffic for a certain protocol and/or port to a particular machine behind
the filtering system. An example of this would be a computer residing inside 
the local network running a web server which was to be accessed by the outside world
(or of course, the already discussed ftp-proxy(8)). Incoming connections to 
your valid Internet IP will find that unless your NAT box is also running
a web server, no connection can be made. For this purpose we use the
NAT 'rdr' directive in the rules file to instruct where to redirect
a particular connection to.

<p>
For our example, lets say a web server resides on the LAN with IP address
of 192.168.1.80. The NAT rules file needs a new directive to handle this.
Add a line similar to the following one to your <i>/etc/pf.conf</i>:

<blockquote><pre>
rdr on fxp0 proto tcp from any to any port 80 -&gt; 192.168.1.80 port 80
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The explanation for each part of this line:

<dl>
<dt>"rdr"
<dd>This is the command you are giving NAT. It is telling NAT 
that this entry is an entry to redirect a connection. 
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>"on fxp0"
<dd>This is the network interface that is connected to the Internet.
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>"from any to any"
<dd>This indicates which IP addresses to redirect (from any coming in 
on fxp0, as indicated above, to any destination IP) 
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>"port 80"
<dd>This is the incoming port (80) that should be redirected. The number
"80" didn't have to be used. You can use "port www" also to specify
a redirection of port 80. If you would like to use a name instead of
a number, the service name and corresponding port must exist in the
file <i>/etc/services</i>.
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>"192.168.1.80 port 80"
<dd>The IP address of the LAN machine which the packets are redirected to. 
Note that the destination port does NOT need to match the incoming port. 
For example, the following is valid, and even potentially useful:
<pre>
rdr on fxp0 proto tcp from any to any port 8080 -&gt; 192.168.1.35 port 80
</pre>
This line would redirect incoming traffic on port 8080 to a webserver
running on a machine in the internal network, at the "standard" port 80.
</dl>

<p>
When the addition is complete reload the NAT rules, and the redirection
will start immediately.

<p>
<b>Negation</b>
<p>
Sometimes, you need to make exceptions to a NAT or redirection rule.
Here's an example.  AOL Instant Messenger is noted for sneaking out 
firewalls through any available port.  You may find that the 
ftp-proxy is interfering with AIM when it chooses to go out to 
remote port 21.  In the event you consider this bad (many people 
spend considerable time trying to block AIM!), you might wish to 
exclude the IP addresses used by the AIM servers from the traffic
redirected by our above ftp-proxy line.  You can do this with the
following line:

<blockquote><pre>
rdr on tl0 proto tcp from any to ! 64.12.163.199 port 21 -&gt; 127.0.0.1 port 8021
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Interpretation: Redirect traffic coming in on tl0 going to port 21 
but NOT to 64.12.163.199 (the AIM server users were having trouble
with) to localhost port 8021 (where
hopefully ftp-proxy is waiting).  Now, be advised that there are many
AIM servers; if this application interests you, you will probably
have to play with these IP addresses (64.12.0.0/16 might be more 
productive, though probably also interferes with some non-AOL sites).

<b>NAT versus Proxy</b>

<p>
The difference between NAT and an application-based proxy is that the proxy
software acts as a middle-man between the Internet and the machines connected
on the LAN. This is fine, however each application you want to run on
your machine and connect to the Internet through the proxy server MUST
be proxy-aware (be able to use a proxy server). Not all applications are
able to do this (especially games). Furthermore, there simply are not
proxy server applications for all of the Internet services out there.
NAT transparently maps
your internal network so that it may connect to the Internet.  The only
security advantage to using a proxy software over NAT is that the proxy
software may have been made security aware, and can filter based on content,
to keep your Windows machine from getting a macro virus, it can protect
against buffer overflows to your client software, and more.  To maintain
these filters is often a high-maintenance job.

<b>Redirection and reflection</b>

<p>
Often, redirection rules are used to forward incoming connections from
the Internet to a local server with a private address in the LAN, as in:

<pre>
rdr on $ext_if proto tcp from any to $ext_if port 80 -&gt; $server port 80
</pre>

<p>
But when the redirection rule is tested from a client on the LAN, it's
found to not work.
The reason is that redirection rules apply only to packets that pass
through the specified interface ($ext_if, the external interface, in
the example).
Connecting to the external address of the firewall from a host on the
LAN, however, does not mean the packets will actually pass through its
external interface.
The TCP/IP stack on the firewall compares the destination address of
incoming packets with its own addresses and aliases, and detects
connections to itself as soon as they have passed the internal interface.
Such packets do not physically pass through the external interface, and
the stack does not simulate such a passage in any way.
pf never sees these packets on the external interface, and the
redirection rule, specifying the external interface, does not apply.

<p>
Adding a second redirection rule for the internal interface does not
have the desired effect.
When the local client connects to the external address of the firewall,
the initial packet of the TCP handshake reaches the firewall through
the internal interface.
The redirection rule does apply and the destination address gets
replaced with that of the internal server.
The packet gets forwarded back through the internal interface and
reaches the internal server.
But the source address has not been translated, and still contains
the local client's address, so the server sends its replies directly
to the client.
The firewall never sees the reply and has no chance to properly reverse
the translation.
The client receives a reply from a source it never expected, and drops
it, the TCP handshake fails, and no connection can be established.

<p>
Still, it's often desirable for clients on the LAN to connect to the
same internal server as external clients, transparently.
There are several solutions for this problem:

<p>
<b>Split horizon DNS</b>
<p>
It's possible to configure DNS servers to answer queries from local
hosts differently than external queries, so that local clients will
receive the internal server's address during name resolution.
They will then connect directly to the local server, and the firewall
isn't involved at all.
This reduces local traffic, since packets don't have to be sent through
the firewall.

<p>
<b>Moving the server into a separate local network</b>
<p>
Adding an additional network interface to the firewall and moving the
local server from the client's network into a dedicated network (DMZ)
allows to redirect connections from local clients in the same way as
the redirection of external connections.
Use of separate networks has several advantages, including improving
security by isolating the server from the remaining local hosts.
Should the server (which in our case is reachable from the Internet)
ever become compromised, it can't access other local hosts directly,
as all connections have to pass through the firewall.

<p>
<b>TCP proxying</b>
<p>
A generic TCP proxy can be setup on the firewall, either listening on
the port to be forwarded or getting connections on the internal interface
redirected to the port it's listening on.
When a local client connects to the firewall, the proxy accepts the
connection, establishes a second connection to the internal server,
and forwards data between those two connections.

<p>
Simple proxies can be created using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;sektion=8">inetd(8)</a>
and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=nc&amp;sektion=1">nc(1)</a>.
The following <i>/etc/inetd.conf</i> entry creates a listening socket
bound to the loopback address and port 5000.
Connections are forwarded to port 80 on server 192.168.1.10.

<pre>
127.0.0.1:5000 stream tcp wait nobody /usr/bin/nc nc -w 20 192.168.1.10 80
</pre>

<p>
The following redirection rule forwards port 80 on the internal interface
to the proxy:

<pre>
rdr on $int_if proto tcp from $int_net to $ext_if port 80 -&gt; 127.0.0.1 port 5000
</pre>

<p>
<b>RDR and NAT combination</b>
<p>
With an additional NAT rule on the internal interface, the lacking
source address translation described above can be achieved.

<pre>
rdr on $int_if proto tcp from $int_net to $ext_if port 80 -&gt; $server
no nat on $int_if proto tcp from $int_if to $int_net
nat on $int_if proto tcp from $int_net to $server port 80 -&gt; $int_if
</pre>

<p>
This will cause the initial packet from the client to be translated again
when it's forwarded back through the internal interface, replacing the
client's source address with the firewall's internal address.
The internal server will reply back to the firewall, which can reverse
both NAT and RDR translations when forwarding to the local client.
This construct is rather complex, as it creates two separate states
for each reflected connection.
Care must taken to prevent the NAT rule from applying to other traffic,
for instance connections originating from external hosts (through
other redirections) or the firewall itself.
Note that the rdr rule above will cause the TCP/IP stack to see packets
arriving on the internal interface with a destination address inside the
internal network.
To prevent the stack from issuing ICMP redirect messages (telling the
client that its destination is reachable directly, breaking the reflection),
disable redirects on the gateway, using

<pre>
# <strong>sysctl -w net.inet.ip.redirect=0</strong>
</pre>

In general, the previously mentioned solutions should be used instead.
