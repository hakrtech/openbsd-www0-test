<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Where's pine (or other GNU/semi-free utility)?</A></H2>

<P>All about ports (as cribbed from <CODE>
<A HREF="http://www.OpenBSD.ORG/ports.html">http://www.OpenBSD.ORG/ports.html</A></CODE>)</P>

<P>OpenBSD is a fairly complete system of its own, but there
still is a lot of software that one might want see added to
their own system.  However, one has to draw the line on what
to include and leave out, as well as having to follow licensing
and export restrictions laws.  Because of these problems, some
software cannot be shipped with the system. We wanted to find
a way for users to easily get software we don't provide and
started to look around. We didn't have to look far because
a sibling project, FreeBSD, has an excellent mechanism for
exactly this purpose called "<B>The Ports Collection</B>". After
thinking about it for a while we decided to try and use their
collection as is, feeding back necessary patches that make
the ports work on OpenBSD as well as FreeBSD.</P>

<P>The ports idea is to have, for each piece of software,
a Makefile that describes where to download it from, how to
alter the sources (if needed) and how to build and install
it. Furthermore some patches will have to be kept in the
"<CODE>port</CODE>" as well as some administration files for the package
registry utilities. Normally this information is kept in an
hierarchy under <CODE>/usr/ports</CODE> (this is configurable,
and can be changed). The entire ports tree can be found at</P>


<P><CODE>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/FreeBSD-current/ports.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/FreeBSD-current/ports.tar.gz</A></CODE></P>

<P>Note that this isn't a file on their server, rather it
archives their directories on-the-fly. The entire collection
is almost 3.1M tarred and gzip'd and will probably be twice
that when uncompressed. The ports tree is also on the 2.1 CD.</P>

<P>Let's say you managed to get a ports tree sitting under
<CODE>/usr/portsi</CODE>, then you should be able to something
like this:</P>

mitnick% su
mitnick# cd /usr/ports/archivers/unzip
mitnick# make
mitnick# make install
mitnick# exit

</P>


<P> Easy, huh?</P>
