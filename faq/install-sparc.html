<h2>Before you get started</h2>

<P>
This document is based partly on <A HREF="ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.6/sparc/INSTALL.sparc">INSTALL.sparc</a>,
from the OpenBSD/sparc distribution set.
If you have further questions or problems installing, please refer to
INSTALL.sparc, as it contains some detailed information not included
with this document.
<p>
There are a few checks you need to make before trying to install 
OpenBSD. 
<ul>
<li>First and foremost you need to make sure that your hardware is
supported by OpenBSD. You can see a list of currently supported hardware
on <a href="/sparc.html">sparc.html</a>.
<li>If you plan to install OpenBSD via your network device, it is
essential that you make sure that your network device is supported.
(Luckily, for supported sparc systems, there aren't very many network
controllers out there.
<li>Make sure you have backed up any information you need.
</ul>

<a name="1.2"></a>
<h2>Creating OpenBSD Bootdisks</h2>

<p>
OpenBSD can be booted via floppy, SCSI hard disk, CD-ROM, or a network boot on the sparc...
<UL>
<LI><h2>Floppy:</h2>
When you are making a boot floppy, first be sure to use a floppy that
has already been formatted! (The
formatting provides the basic disk layout with sectors and tracks
so that the floppy drive knows how to read it!)
<P>
To format in MS-DOS, just use the FORMAT command.  In OpenBSD, you should use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdformat&sektion=1&format=
html">fdformat(1)</a>
like this (note <tt>fd0a</tt> refers to the entire floppy disk unless
you actually have a disklabel on your floppy!):
<UL><pre>
# <b>fdformat /dev/fd0a</b>
Format 1440K floppy `/dev/fd0a'? (y/n): <b>y</b>
Processing VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV done.
</UL></pre>

<P>
There are multiple ways to make a boot disk depending on your current
architecture. There are a few programs availible in the
<a href="ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/tools/">tools</a> directory on
any of the ftp mirrors, or in <b>2.6/tools</b> on CD1 on the OpenBSD CD.
If you are already on a UNIX-like Operating System (or a Unix operating
system such as Solaris), you can use 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dd&sektion=1&format=html">dd(1)</a>
to write your boot floppy. Here is an example usage of dd(1) to correctly
write the OpenBSD boot floppy:

<ul><pre>
# <strong>dd if=floppy26.fs of=/dev/fd0c bs=126b</strong>
</pre></ul>
<P>
Note that the bs=126b option can be ignored if your version of dd does not
support these large block sizes.
<P>If you are using something other than OpenBSD, you may have to adapt
this to conform to local naming conventions for the floppy and
options suitable for copying to a "raw" floppy image.  The key
issue is that the device name used for the floppy <i>must</i> be one
that refers to the whole 2880 block image, not a partition or
compatibility mode, and the copy command needs to be compatible
with the requirement that writes to a raw device must be in
multiples of 512-byte blocks.  The variations are endless and
beyond the scope of this document.
<P>
For Solaris users, you can use /dev/rfd0c as your floppy device.
<P>
If you want to use a computer with MS-DOS, Windows, or Windows NT
to write the sparc boot floppy, please see <A HREF="install-i386.html#1.2">section 1.2 of install-i386.html</a>.
<P>
<LI><H2>SCSI Hard Disk:</H2>
<P>
If you don't have a floppy drive you can copy the single floppy
installation image "floppy26.fs"
onto the hard disk you intend to boot on.  Traditionally, the
way to do this is to use dd(1) to place the bootable filesystem
image in the "swap" partition of the disk (while running in
single user mode), and then booting from that partition.
<P>
Using the "b" partition allows you to boot without overwriting
any useful parts of the disk, you can also use another partition,
but don't used the "a" or "c" partition without understanding
the disklabel issues described below under "incompatible systems".
<P>
This requires that you be running SunOS, Solaris, OpenBSD or NetBSD
which have a compatible view of SunOS disk labels and partitions.
<P>
Use the dd(1) utility to copy the file to the hard drive.
Under SunOS, the command would be:
<P>
<UL>
<PRE>
# <strong>dd if=floppy26.fs of=/dev/rsd0b bs=36b</strong>
</PRE></UL>
<P>
The blocksize is arbitrary as long as it's a multiple of 512-bytes
and within the maximum supported by the driver, i.e. bs=36b may
not work for all cases.  Again, device/partition names may vary,
depending on the OS involved.
<P>
If you are preparing the hard drive on an incompatible system or
don't care about the hard disk contents, you can also install the
bootable image starting at the beginning of the disk. This lets
you prepare a bootable hard-drive even if don't have a working
operating system on your Sparc, but it important to understand
that the bootable image installed this way includes a "disk label"
which can wipe out any pre-existing disklabels or partitioning for
the drive.
<P>
To copy the floppy image to the whole disk, overwriting labels:
<P>
<UL><PRE>
# <strong>dd if=floppy26.fs of=/dev/rsdXc bs=36b</strong>
</PRE></UL>
<P>
The <tt>X</tt> should be replaced by the unit number of the target
disk, which is most likely <i>not</i> the disk/partition that's your
current root partition.  Again names may vary depending on the
OS involved.  Second, after doing this, the disklabel will be one
that would be appropriate for a floppy, i.e. one partition of 2880
block, and you'll probably want to change that later on.
<P>
To copy the floppy image to the hard disk, preserving SunOS,
Solaris, NetBSD, or OpenBSD labels:
<P>
<UL><PRE>
# <strong>dd if=floppy26.fs of=/dev/rsdXc bs=1b skip=1 seek=1</strong>
</PRE></UL>
<P>
You need to be sure that your version of dd(1) supports the
skip and seek operands, otherwise you can try a technique like:
<P>
<UL><PRE>
# <strong>dd if=/dev/rsdXc of=/tmp/label bs=1b count=1</strong>
# <strong>dd if=floppy26.fs of=/dev/rsdXc bs=36b</strong>
# <strong>dd if=/tmp/label of=/dev/rsdXc bs=1b count=1</strong>
</PRE></UL>
<P>
In either case, you've created a situation where the disklabel
and the filesystem information don't agree about the partition
size and geometry.  Make sure you set this properly when you boot up.
<P>
<LI><H2>CDROM:</H2>
<P>
To boot from CD-ROM, place your OpenBSD CD-ROM disk into your drive.
If your Sun only has one CD-ROM drive, then just go to the boot prompt,
where you can '<tt>boot cdrom</tt>':
<UL><PRE>
ok <b>boot cdrom</b>
</PRE></UL>
Of course, this will only work in new command mode.  If you are at the old command mode prompt (a right arrow), type 'n' for the new command mode. 
(If you are using an old sparc that is pre-sun4c, you probably don't have
a new command mode.  In this case, you need to experiment.)
If you have multiple CD-ROM devices, you need to boot from the correct one.
Try <tt>probe-scsi</tt> from the new command mode.
<UL><PRE>
ok <b>probe-scsi</b>
Target 0
  Unit 0   Disk     QUANTUM LIGHTNING 365S
Target 1
  Unit 0   Removable Disk     QUANTUM EMPIRE_1080S   
Target 3
  Unit 0   Removable Disk     Joe's CD ROMs
</PRE></UL>
<P>
Figure out which disk is the CD ROM you want to boot from.  Note the
target number.  
<UL><PRE>
ok <b>boot /sbus/esp/sd@X,0</b>
</PRE></UL>
Replace <tt>X</tt> with the target number of your CDROM.
<P>
<LI><H2>Network boot:</H2>
<P>
The details of setting up a network bootable environment vary
considerably, depending on the network's host.  Read the OpenBSD
<A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=diskless&sektion=8&format=html">diskless(8)</a>
man page. You will also need to reference the relevant man pages or administrators guide
for the host system.
<P>        
Basically, you will need to set up reverse-arp (rarpd) and boot
parameter (bootpd) information and make the OpenBSD bootblock,
kernel/miniroot partition, and a swap file available as required
by the netboot setup.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<a name="1.3"></a>
<h2>Booting OpenBSD on the sparc</h2>

<P>First, you need to be aware that Sun's default set is to make the first
SCSI drive exist as SCSI device #3 (or target 3.)  Normally, OpenBSD does not pay
attention to this, and so if you boot OpenBSD off of SCSI target 3, 
any disk at target 0, 1, or 2 will become sd0 to the kernel before
the actual disk at target 3 (which we assume is your main disk and therefore
would be sd0.)  To get around this, boot the bsd.scsi3 kernel.
<UL><PRE>
ok <b>boot bsd.scsi3</b>
</PRE></UL>
This kernel has scsi target 3 hard-wired as sd0, to match the SunOS/Solaris
behavior.  You probably want to copy this file to /bsd as to automate
further boots.
<p>
If you are booting from floppy26.fs, the kernel and all of the programs
that OpenBSD uses to install itself are loaded into memory.  If problems arise,
and your bootdisk doesn't boot, the problem is probobly due to a
bad floppy disk. This is an extremly common problem!  If your bootdisk fails
to boot, try it a second time, and if it fails again, throw away the floppy
and get a new one.  When your floppy fails to boot, even if the floppy worked
fine for you before, keep in mind that OpenBSD uses nearly every single
bit available from the floppy!
Any error in the disk will prevent OpenBSD from loading.
<P>
If you are booting from a harddisk or other source, the considerations
for bad floppies obviously don't apply.

<P>
When your boot is successful, you will see a lot of test
from the kernel telling you what devices have been found,
and where.  Then, you will see the following:

<UL><pre>
sh: /etc/rc: No such file or directory
Enter pathname of shell or RETURN for sh: <b>&lt;Enter&gt;</b>
erase ^?, werase ^W, kill ^U, intr ^C
</UL></pre>
Of course, you want to answer I, for <i>Install</i>
<UL><pre>
(I)nstall, (U)pgrade or (S)hell? <b>I</b>
</UL></pre>

Then, you will see some description of the install, and it will ask your
terminal type...Just press enter here, sun is the correct terminal type.

<UL><pre>
You can run a shell command at any prompt via '!foo'
or escape to a shell by simply typing '!'.

Specify terminal type [sun]: <b>&lt;Enter&gt;</b>
</UL></pre>

Next, you get to select what disk you are going to setup for OpenBSD.
If you have any data on this disk you want to backup, be sure to do
so before you start this process.

<UL><pre>
Available disks are:

sd0

Which disk is the root disk? [sd0]
</UL></pre>

<tt>sd0</tt> would be the correct answer if you are trying to format your first SCSI
disk.  If you are installing OpenBSD on your second or third disk, select appropriately.  If the answer in brackets (in this example, <tt>sd0</tt>) is 
what you want, you can just hit enter.

<h2>Setting up your OpenBSD filesystems with disklabel</h2>
<P>
Check out <A HREF="faq14.html#14.1">section 14.1</a> of the FAQ for
details on how to use disklabel.
Look at <A HREF="faq4.html#4.5">section 4.5</a> of the FAQ for details on
what sizes to use for your filesystems.
<P>
For a multiuser machine, it is best to make at least five separate filesystems,
one for your / filesystem, one for swap, one for /var, one for /tmp, and
one for /usr.   If your users are going to store files of any
significant size, you want a separate /home filesystem too.
<P>
There are four main reasons for using separate filesystems, instead of shoving
everything into one or two filesystems:
<UL>
<LI><b>Security</b>: You can mark some filesystems as 'nosuid', 'nodev', 'noexec', 'readonly', etc..
<LI><b>Stability</b>: A user, or a misbehaved program, can fill a filesystem with garbage, if they have write permissions for it.  Your critical programs, which of course run on a different filesystem, do not get interrupted.
<LI><b>Speed</b>: A filesystem which gets written to frequently may get somewhat fragmented.  (Luckily, the ffs filesystem, what OpenBSD uses, is not prone to heavy fragmentation.)
<LI><b>Integrity</b>: If one filesystem is corrupted for some reason then your other filesystems are still OK.
</UL>

<a name="1.5"></a>
<h2>Configuring your mountpoints and formating your filesystems</h2>

<p>
Setting up your mountpoints is much more simple then it looks.

After you setup your filesystems with disklabel,
will see text like the following:
</p>

<ul><pre>
The following filesystems will be used for the root filesystem and swap:
        sd0a    /
        sd0b    swap

Mount point for sd0d (size=65520k) [/tmp, RET, none, or done]? <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
Mount point for sd0e (size=65520k) [/var, RET, none, or done]? <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
Mount point for sd0g (size=307440k) [/usr, RET, none, or done]? <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
Mount point for sd0h (size=1926256k) [/home, RET, none, or done]? <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
</pre></ul>

<p>
This shows that sd0a has been set as the root filesystem and sd0b as the swap. This SHOULD be the same
for all, exept of course sd0 will be changed with whatever disk device you are using. In the example above
our mountpoint's have already been determained via disklabel(8), but you should still review to make sure 
all of this information is correct, this is your last chance of changing it! For users with multiple disk's, 
this will also be your chance to configure your other disks. So don't fret and try to stick all mountpoints on 
one disk. You will be given a list like below:
</p>

<ul><pre>
Now you can select another disk to initialize.  (Do not re-select a
disk you have already entered information for).  Available disks are:

sd0
sd1

Which one? [done] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>

You have configured the following devices and mount points:

sd0a /
sd0d /tmp
sd0e /var
sd0g /usr
sd0h /home

Filesystems will now be created on these devices.
If you made any mistakes, you may edit this now.
Edit using ed? [n] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
</ul></pre>

<p>
As you can see, It was decided not to use sd1 at the present time. If it was chosen to setup the other disk,
it would have been done exactly as the first disk you setup. You do get 1 last chance to correct things via 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ed&sektion=1&format=html">ed(1)</a>, 
but its much easier to varify the information earlier. Once the filesystems have been set, it's time to 
format the disks. You will be prompted with a warning telling you that all information will be erased. That is why,
if you are multi-booting this system, it's very important to have taken proper backups. Here is an example:
</p>

<ul><pre>
============================================================
The next step will overwrite any existing data on:
        sd0a sd0d sd0e sd0g sd0h

Are you really sure that you're ready to proceed? [n] <strong>y</strong>
</ul></pre>

<p>
Notice this answer defaults to no, so you will have to directly tell it to format your labels. If you chose no you will
simply be dropped into a shell and can start the install again by typing
<strong>install</strong>, or just rebooting 
again with your bootdisk. At this point it will format all filesystems for you, this could take some time depending on 
the size of your disk. 
</p>

<a name="1.6"></a>
<h2>Configuring your Network</h2>


<p>
Not it's time to setup your network configuration. This is extremely important if you are planning on doing any network based install,
ocnsidering it will be based upon the information you are about to enter. Here is a walkthrough of the network configuration section of
the install process.
</p>

<ul><pre>
You will now be given the opportunity to configure the network.  This will be
useful if you need to transfer the installation sets via FTP, HTTP, or NFS.
Even if you choose not to transfer installation sets that way, this information
will be preserved and copied into the new root filesystem.

Configure the network [y] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
Enter system hostname (short form): [] <strong>mybox</strong>
Enter DNS domain name: [] <strong>someisp.com</strong>

If you have any devices being configured by a DHCP server
it is recommended that you do not enter a default route or
any name servers.

You may configure the following network interfaces (the interfaces marked
with [X] have been successfully configured):

        [ ] le0
        [ ] hme0

Configure which interface? (or, enter 'done') [le0] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
IP address (or 'dhcp')? [] <strong>199.185.137.55</strong>
Symbolic (host) name? [mybox] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
Netmask ? [255.255.255.0] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
Your network interface might require non-default
media directives.  The default media is:
        media: Ethernet 10baseT half-duplex
This is a list of supported media:
        media autoselect
        media 100baseTX mediaopt full-duplex
        media 100baseTX mediaopt half-duplex
        media 100baseTX
        media 10baseT mediaopt full-duplex
        media 10baseT
        media 10baseT mediaopt half-duplex
If the default is not satisfactory, and you wish to use another
media, copy that line from above (ie. "media 100baseTX")
Media directives? [] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>

You may configure the following network interfaces (the interfaces marked
with [X] have been successfully configured):

        [X] le0
        [ ] hme0

Configure which interface? (or, enter 'done') [done] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
</ul></pre>

<p>
In this example we have two network interfaces, but will only configure one of them. You do have the ability to configure both interfaces
during the install, but for simplicity we will only go over one. To start off, if your not using DHCP, you will need to know information
about your network setup. Information like your IP, Netmask, and gateway. If your using DHCP you will just put DHCP in as your IP and all
this information will be retrieved for you. Notice that you also have a chance to specify media directives if your NIC supports any.
Next you will get a chance to specify your default route's and nameserver. This will be needed if your doing a network based install.
</p>

<ul><pre>
Configure which interface? (or, enter 'done') [done] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
Enter IP address of default route: [none] <strong>199.185.137.128</strong>
Enter IP address of primary nameserver: [none] <strong>199.185.137.1</strong>
Would you like to use the nameserver now? [y] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>

You will now be given the opportunity to escape to the command shell to do
any additional network configuration you may need.  This may include adding
additional routes, if needed.  In addition, you might take this opportunity
to redo the default route in the event that it failed above.
Escape to shell? [n] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
</ul></pre>

<p>
At this point you can escape to a shell which will allow you to make any corrections to your network setup, or any specific changes that
the install script might not allow you to do. Most will not need to do this.
</p>

<a name="1.7"></a>
<h2>Choosing Installation Media</h2>

<p>
After your network is setup, the install script will give you a chance to make any changes to your network setup. (Mainly if errors were
produced.) Then the filesystems you created will be mounted and a root password set. This will get your local disks ready for the OpenBSD
packages to be installed upon them. After your local disks are ready you will get a chance to choose your installation media. The options
are listed below.
</p>


<ul><pre>
You will now be given the opportunity to escape to the command shell to do
any additional network configuration you may need.  This may include adding
additional routes, if needed.  In addition, you might take this opportunity
to redo the default route in the event that it failed above.
Escape to shell? [n] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
/dev/sd0a on /mnt type ffs (rw, asynchronous, local)
/dev/sd0d on /mnt/tmp type ffs (rw, asynchronous, local)
/dev/sd0e on /mnt/var type ffs (rw, asynchronous, local)
/dev/sd0g on /mnt/usr type ffs (rw, asynchronous, local)
/dev/sd0h on /mnt/home type ffs (rw, asynchronous, local)

Please enter the initial password that the root account will have.
Password (will not echo): _
Password (again): _

It is now time to extract the installation sets onto the hard disk.  Make sure
the sets are either on a local device (i.e. tape, CD-ROM) or on a network
server.  You will have the chance to repeat this step or to extract sets from
several places, so you don't have to try to load all the sets in one try and
can recover from some errors.

Install from (f)tp, (h)ttp, (t)ape, (C)D-ROM, (N)FS or local (d)isk? <strong>&lt;Enter Option Here&gt;</strong>
</ul></pre>

<a name="1.8"></a>
<h2>Installing via CD-ROM</h2>

<p>
To install via CD-ROM, you will select option 'C' when choosing your installation media. This will bring up a list of 
devices on your computer identified as a CD-ROM. Most people will only have one, if you don't you need to make sure you pick 
the device in which you will be installing the OpenBSD from. After choosing the correct device, you will be prompted for which filesystem
the installation files will reside on. If you are using the OpenBSD CD-ROM you will choose 'c' here, for 'c' represents the whole disk.
Here is an example:
</p>

<ul><pre>
Install from (f)tp, (h)ttp, (t)ape, (C)D-ROM, (N)FS or local (d)isk? <strong>c</strong>

The following CD-ROM devices are installed on your system; please select
the CD-ROM device containing the partition with the installation sets:

cd0

Which is the CD-ROM with the installation media? [abort] <strong>cd0</strong>
Partition? [c] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
</ul></pre>

<p>
Now you will be prompted for which filesystem to use when reading the CD-ROM, and to what directory the installation files are.
If you are using the official OpenBSD CD-ROM, you will use 'cd9660' as your filesystem. (Which is the default.) You will then be using
'/2.6/sparc/' as the directory in which the files reside. (Again, this is the default option.) After this you will get a list of packages
to install. You can get a description of these files in <a href="faq4.html#4.4">faq4.4</a>. Here is what you will be seeing:
</p>

<ul><pre>
There are two CD-ROM filesystem types currently supported by this program:
cd9660          ISO-9660
ffs             Berkeley Fast Filesystem

Which filesystem type? [cd9660] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
Enter the directory relative to the mount point that
contains the file. [/2.6/sparc] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>

You will now be asked for files to extract.  In addition to the
files listed in the selector you may enter any file located in
/mnt2//2.6/sparc.  You can also enter 'all' to install all the standard
sets, or 'list' to list the files avilable in /mnt2//2.6/sparc.
When you are done selecting files, enter 'done'.
Some of these sets are required for your install and some are optional --
You will want at least the base and bsd sets.
Consult the intallation notes if you are not sure which sets are required!
</ul></pre>

<p>
After this move on to the <a href="#1.12">Choosing installation packages and finishing the install.</a> to finish off your install.
</p>

<a name="1.9">
<h2>Installing via Local Filesystem</h2>

<a name="1.11">
<h2>Installing via NFS</h2>

<a name="1.12"></a>
<h2>Choosing installation packages and finishing the install.</h2>

<p>
Now it's time to choose which packages you will be installing. You can get a description of these files in <a href="faq4.html#4.4">faq4.4</a>.
The files that the installdisk finds will be shown too you on the screen. Your job is just to specify which files you want. By default
only 4 packages are selected. These are 'base26.tar.gz', 'etc26.tar.gz', 'man26.tar.gz' and 'bsd'. This is because these 3 files MUST be present for you
to have any sort of a functional system. The rest are left up to your discresion. The example below is that of a full install, minus the
games package.

Once you have successfully picked which packages you want, you will be prompted to make sure you want to extract these packages and they
will then be insatlled. A progress bar will be shown that will keep you informed on how much time it will take. The times range greatly
depending on what system it is you are installing OpenBSD on. After this your configuration files ( networking and filesystem ) will be
moved onto your disks also from the installdisk.

Your not quite done with choosing packages. One library, which is not on the CD must be downloaded. As it is
explained during the install, if you don't have network connectivity just yet, this can be added at any time
later. This install assumes that a network is available and ready during the install. First you will see an
explaination and then be given choices on which package you want to select. After you have selected your package
you need to setup your network.
 </p>

<ul><pre>
Two OpenBSD libraries (libssl and libcrypto, based on OpenSSL) implement many
cryptographic functions which are used by OpenBSD programs like ssh, httpd, and
isakmpd.  Due to patent licensing reasons, those libraries may not be included
on the CD -- instead the base distribution contains libraries which have had
the troublesome code removed -- the programs listed above will not be fully
functional as a result.  Libraries which _include_ the troublesome routines
are available and can be FTP installed, as long as you meet the follow (legal)
criteria:
  (1) Outside the USA, no restrictions apply. Use ssl26.tar.gz.
  (2) Inside the USA, non-commercial entities may install sslUSA26.tar.gz.
  (3) Commercial entities in the USA are left in the cold, due to how the
      licences work.  (This is how the USA crypto export policy feels to the
      rest of the world.)

If you do not install the ssl package now, it is easily installed at
a later time (see the afterboot(8) and ssl(8) manual pages)."

Here is where you will setup your network, if you need help with this part you can refer to <a href="#1.6">Configuring your Network</a>.
After your network interfaces are configured correctly, you will be given a list of ftp servers and their
locations. You must choose one of them.

HTTP/FTP proxy URL? (ie. "http://proxy:8080", or "none") [none] <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>

By default, ftp will attempt a passive connection and fall back to a normal
(active) connection if that doesn't work.  However, there are some very
old ftp servers that claim to support passive mode, but really do not.
In this case, you should explicitly request an active session.

You will now be asked for files to extract. In addition to the files listed,
you may select any file located at ftp.openbsd.org:pub/OpenBSD/2.6/sparc
You can also enter 'all' to install all the standard sets, or 'list' to list
the files available. When you are done selecting files, enter 'done'. Some of
these sets are required for your install and some are optional -- you will want
at least the base and bsd sets. Consult the installation notes if you are not
sure which sets are required!

The following sets are available for extraction.
Enter filename, `list', `all', or `done'.
You may de-select a set by prepending a '-' to its name.

Once this is done, all thats left is to set your timezone and install the bootblocks. Setting your timezone is extremely easy. Just pick
the area you live in and enter the name. Thats it!

<pre><ul>
Select a time zone for your location. Timezones are represented on the
system by a directory structure rooted in "/usr/share/timezone". Most
timezones can be selected by entering a token like "MET" or "GMT-6".
Other zones are grouped by continent, with detailed zone information
separated by a slash ("/"), e.g. "US/Pacific" or "Canada/Mountain".

To get a listing of what's available in /usr/share/zoneinfo, enter "?"
at the prompts below.

<h2>After your reboot</h2>

<p>
This section will hopefully point you in the right direction for clues on what to do initially after you 
have installed your OpenBSD system. This is basically modeled after the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=afterboot&sektion=8&format=html">afterboot(8)</a> man page. Which
should definately be one of your first steps after installing OpenBSD. Here is a table which will point you to relevant
FAQ sections.

<LI><a href="faq6.html#6.1">Initial Network Setup</a>

<p>
<p>
Just to remind people, it's important for the OpenBSD developers to keep track
of what hardware works, and what hardware doesn't work perfectly..
</p>

<p>
A quote from /usr/src/etc/root/root.mail
<pre>
If you wish to ensure that OpenBSD runs better on your machines, please do us
a favor (after you have your mail system setup!) and type
        dmesg | mail dmesg@openbsd.org
so that we can see what kinds of configurations people are running.  We will
use this information to improve device driver support in future releases.
(We would be much happier if this information was for the supplied GENERIC
kernel; not for a custom compiled kernel).  The device driver information
we get from this helps us fix existing drivers.
</pre>
Also check with <a href= "faq14.html#14.7">section 14.7</a>
</p>
<p>
Make sure you send email from an account that is able to also receive
email so developers can contact you back if they have something they want
you to test or change in order to get your setup working. It's not important
at all to send the email from the same machine that is running OpenBSD, so
if that machine is unable to receive email, just
<pre>
 dmesg | mail your-account@yourmail.dom
</pre>
and then forward that message to
<pre>
 dmesg@openbsd.org
</pre>
where <tt>your-account@yourmail.dom</tt> is your regular email account.
(or transfer the dmesg output using ftp/scp/floppydisk/carrier-pigeon/...)
</p>

<p>
<strong>NOTE</strong> - Please send only GENERIC kernel dmesg's. Custom
kernels that have device drivers removed are not helpful.

<STRONG>Question:</STRONG> - Does OpenBSD provide an ISO image available for download?
</p>

<p>
<STRONG>Answer:</STRONG> - 
You can't. The official OpenBSD CD-ROM layout is copyright Theo de Raadt, as an
incentive for people to buy the CD set.

Note that only the layout is copyrighted, OpenBSD itself is free.
Nothing precludes someone else to just grab OpenBSD and make their own CD.
