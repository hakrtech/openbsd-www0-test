=================================================
Welcome to the OpenBSD/i386 2.4 installation program.

This program is designed to help you put OpenBSD on your disk in a simple and
rational way.

As with anything which modifies your disk's contents, this program can cause
SIGNIFICANT data loss, and you are advised to make sure your data is backed
up before beginning the installation process.

Default answers are displayed in brackets after the questions.  You can hit
Control-C at any time to quit, but if you do so at a prompt, you may have
to hit return.  Also, quitting in the middle of installation may leave your
system in an inconsistent state.  If you hit Control-C and restart the
install, the install program will remember many of your old answers.

Proceed with installation? [n] _y

Cool! Let's get to it...
Specify terminal type [pcvt25]: _

The installation program needs to know which disk to consider the root disk.
Note the unit number may be different than the unit number you used in the
boot program (especially on a PC with multiple disk controllers).
Available disks are:

wd0
wd1
sd0

Which disk is the root disk [wd0]? _

A single OpenBSD partition with id 'A6' ('OpenBSD') should exist in the MBR.
All of your OpenBSD partitions will be contained _within_ this partition,
including your swap space.  In the normal case it should be the only partition
marked as active.  (Unless you are using a multiple-OS booter, but you can
adjust that later.)  Furthermore, the MBR partitions must NOT overlap each
other.  [If this is a new install, you are most likely going to want to type
the following fdisk commands: reinit, update, write, quit. Use the 'manual'
command to read a full description.]  The current partition information is:

Use 'write' to update disk.

Inside the BIOS 'A6' ('OpenBSD') partition you just created, there resides an
OpenBSD partition table which defines how this BIOS partition is to be split
up. This table declares the offsets and sizes of your / partition, your swap
space, and any other partitions you might create.  (NOTE: The OpenBSD disk
label offsets are absolute, ie. relative to the start of the disk... NOT
relative to the start of the BIOS 'A6' partition).

If this disk is shared with other operating systems, those operating systems
should have a BIOS partition entry that spans the space they occupy completely.
For safety, also make sure all OpenBSD file systems are within the offset and
size specified in the 'A6' BIOS partition table.  (By default, the disklabel
editor will try to enforce this).  If you are unsure of how to use multiple
partitions properly (ie. seperating /,  /usr, /tmp, /var, /usr/local, and other
things) just split the space into a root and swap partition for now.

# using MBR partition 3: type A6 off 63 (0x3f) size 4991553 (0x4c2a41)

Treating sectors 63-16386300 as the OpenBSD portion of the disk.
You can use the 'b' command to change this.

You will now have the opportunity to enter filesystem information for wd0.
You will be prompted for the mount point (full path, including the prepending
'/' character) for each BSD partition on wd0.  Enter "none" to skip a
partition or "done" when you are finished.

The following partitions will be used for the root filesystem and swap:
	wd0a	/
	wd0b	swap

Mount point for wd0d (size=65520k) [, RET, none, or done]? _/tmp
Mount point for wd0e (size=65520k) [, RET, none, or done]? _/var
Mount point for wd0g (size=307440k) [, RET, none, or done]? _/usr
Mount point for wd0h (size=1926256k) [, RET, none, or done]? _/home
Mount point for wd0d (size=65520k) [/tmp, RET, none, or done]? _done

Nowq you can select another disk to initialize.  (Do not re-select a
disk you have already entered information for).  Available disks are:

wd0
wd1
sd0

Which one? [done] _

You have configured the following devices and mount points:

wd0a /
wd0d /tmp
wd0e /var
wd0g /usr
wd0h /home

Filesystems will now be created on these devices.
If you made any mistakes, you may edit this now.
Edit using ed? [n] _

============================================================
The next step will overwrite any existing data on:
	wd0a wd0d wd0e wd0g wd0h

Are you really sure that you're ready to proceed? [n] _y
[...]

You will now be given the opportunity to configure the network.  This will be
useful if you need to transfer the installation sets via FTP, HTTP, or NFS.
Even if you choose not to transfer installation sets that way, this information
will be preserved and copied into the new root filesystem.

Configure the network [y] _
Enter system hostname (short form): [] _mybox
Enter DNS domain name: [] _someisp.com

If you have any devices being configured by a DHCP server
it is recommended that you do not enter a default route or
any name servers.

You may configure the following network interfaces (the interfaces marked
with [X] have been successfully configured):

	[ ] xl0
	[ ] fxp0

Configure which interface? (or, enter 'done') [xl0] _
IP address (or 'dhcp')? [] _199.185.137.55
Symbolic (host) name? [mybox] _
Netmask ? [255.255.255.0] _
Your network interface might require non-default
media directives.  The default media is:
	media: Ethernet 100baseTX half-duplex
This is a list of supported media:
        media autoselect
        media 100baseTX mediaopt full-duplex
        media 100baseTX mediaopt half-duplex
        media 100baseTX
        media 10baseT mediaopt full-duplex
        media 10baseT
        media 10baseT mediaopt half-duplex
If the default is not satisfactory, and you wish to use another
media, copy that line from above (ie. "media 100baseTX")
Media directives? [] _

You may configure the following network interfaces (the interfaces marked
with [X] have been successfully configured):

	[X] xl0
	[ ] fxp0

Configure which interface? (or, enter 'done') [done] _
Enter IP address of default route: [none] _199.185.137.128
Enter IP address of primary nameserver: [none] _199.185.137.1
Would you like to use the nameserver now? [y] _

You will now be given the opportunity to escape to the command shell to do
any additional network configuration you may need.  This may include adding
additional routes, if needed.  In addition, you might take this opportunity
to redo the default route in the event that it failed above.
Escape to shell? [n] _
/dev/wd0a on /mnt type ffs (local)
/dev/wd0d on /mnt/tmp type ffs (local)
/dev/wd0e on /mnt/var type ffs (local)
/dev/wd0g on /mnt/usr type ffs (local)
/dev/wd0h on /mnt/home type ffs (local)

Please enter the initial password that the root account will have.

Password (again): _

It is now time to extract the installation sets onto the hard disk.  Make sure
the sets are either on a local device (i.e. tape, CD-ROM) or on a network
server.  You will have the chance to repeat this step or to extract sets from
several places, so you don't have to try to load all the sets in one try and
can recover from some errors.

Install from (f)tp, (h)ttp, (t)ape, (C)D-ROM, (N)FS or local (d)isk? _c

The following CD-ROM devices are installed on your system; please select
the CD-ROM device containing the partition with the installation sets:

acd0
cd0

Which is the CD-ROM with the installation media? [abort] _acd0
Partition? [c] _

There are two CD-ROM filesystem types currently supported by this program:
cd9660		ISO-9660
ffs		Berkeley Fast Filesystem

Which filesystem type? [cd9660] _
Enter the directory relative to the mount point that
contains the file. [/2.4/i386] _

You will now be asked for files to extract.  In addition to the
files listed in the selector you may enter any file located in
/mnt2//2.4/i386.  You can also enter 'all' to install all the standard
sets, or 'list' to list the files avilable in /mnt2//2.4/i386.
When you are done selecting files, enter 'done'.
Some of these sets are required for your install and some are optional --
You will want at least the base and bsd sets.
Consult the intallation notes if you are not sure which sets are required!

The following sets are available for extraction.
Enter filename, `list', `all', or `done'.
You may de-select a set by prepending a '-' to it's name.

	[X] base23.tar.gz
	[X] etc23.tar.gz

Select a time zone for your location. Timezones are represented on the
system by a directory structure rooted in "/usr/share/timezone". Most
timezones can be selected by entering a token like "MET" or "GMT-6".
Other zones are grouped by continent, with detailed zone information
separated by a slash ("/"), e.g. "US/Pacific" or "Canada/Mountain".
