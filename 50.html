<h3><font color="#0000e0">What's New</font></h3>
<p>
This is a partial list of new features and systems included in OpenBSD 5.0.
For a comprehensive list, see the <a href="plus50.html">changelog</a> leading
to 5.0.
<p>

<ul>

<li>Improved hardware support, including:
    <ul>
    <li>MSI interrupts for many devices, on those architectures which can
      support them (amd64, i386, sparc64 only so far).
    <li>A new dma_alloc(9) API makes it easier for kernel code to allocate
      dma-safe memory.  Many drivers (especially network drivers) and
      subsystems (in particular scsi and the buffer cache) were adapted
      to use this.
    <li>As a result, big-memory support has been enabled on all possible
      architectures.
    <li>The rather rare bce(4) driver now copies mbufs all the time, to cope
      with the hardware having a 1GB limit.
    <li>Added hds(4), a driver for Hitachi Modular Storage SCSI devices.
    <li>Added myx(4), a driver for the Myricom Myri-10G 10GB Ethernet devices.
    <li>Added dfs(4), a driver for Dynamic Frequency Switching on some macppc
      systems.
    <li>cardbus(4) and pcmcia(4) support on sgi.
    <li>Suspend/resume support on Loongson Yeelong laptops.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>Generic network stack improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>Added support for sending Wake on Lan packets using arp(8).
    <li>Permit turning Wake on Lan support on/off using ifconfig(8).
    <li>Added Wake on Lan support to xl(4), re(4), and vr(4).
    <li>Allow ftp-proxy to proxy across rdomains.
    <li>The IPv4 stack will no longer accept ICMP redirects when
      acting as a router.
    <li>By default the IPv6 stack will not process ICMP6 redirects.
      rtsol(8) will turn it back if -F is used.
    <li>Reworked large parts of the dhclient(8) options processing for better
      interoperability.
    <li>Fixed carp(4) to work in IPv6 only setups.
    <li>Make it possible to bind(2) to the local network broadcast address
      on datagram and raw sockets.
    <li>The default multicast reject route is now ignored if the UDP socket
      uses the IP_MULTICAST_IF socket option.
    <li>Make gre(4) work between systems in the same LAN.
    <li>Removed the link1 mode special addressing mode on lo(4).
    <li>Kernel randomization speed and quality improved substantially.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>Routing daemons and other userland network improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>bgpd(8) no longer bumps the rlimits: the rc.d framework respects
      login classes which is a much better solution.
    <li>Correctly set the network filtersets on reload in bgpd(8).
    <li>The routing socket is now sending RTM_DESYNC messages if the
       socketbuffer overflows.
    <li>Allow ospfd(8) to send out LS updates and other messages
      larger than the MTU.
    <li>Fixed nexthop calculation in ospfd(8) for directly connected P2P links.
    <li>First bits to support opaque LSA in ospfd(8).  Only basic redistribute
      logic and LSDB handling for now.
    <li>Creating new interfaces will no longer cause a fatal error in ospf6d(8).
    <li>ospf6d(8) handles link-state changes better.
    <li>Better loopback handling in ospf6d(8).
    <li>No longer install extra multicast routes in ripd(8) and ldpd(8).
    <li>Make kqueue(2) work with sosplice(9).
    <li>Enabled sosplice(9) in relayd(8) for TCP.
    <li>Added support for divert-to which provides some benefits over
      rdr-to in relayd(8).
    <li>Fixed trap sending in snmpd(8).
    <li>Make ping6(8) compare minimum amount of bytes between what
      was received and what was sent out.
    <li>Make traceroute(8) with type-of-service setted (-t) display
      a message if the returned packet has a different tos type.
    <li>Added the socket splicing fields of struct socket to netstat -vP output.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>pf(4) improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>Make pf(4) reassemble IPv6 fragments.  In the forward case, pf
      refragments the packets with the same maximum size.
    <li>Allow pf(4) to filter on the rdomain a packet belongs to.
    <li>Make pf(4) allow userland proxies to establish cross rdomain
      proxy sessions.
    <li>Added IPv6 ACK prioritization in pf(4).
    <li>Change 'set skip on <...>' to work with interface groups.
    <li>pfsync(4) supports IPv6 as network protocol.
    <li>Switched ftp-proxy(8) over to divert-to instead of rdr-to.
    <li>tftp-proxy(8) uses 'divert-to' as well.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>SCSI improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>most SCSI hardware drivers now use the new iopools infrastructure.
    <li>scsi(4) devices are now all provided with a unique devid, which
      is displayed during the probe process.
    <li>ASC/ASCQ error codes and verbiage now in sync with
      http://www.t10.org/lists/asc-num.txt.
    <li>progress on iSCSI includes better login, better logout, preliminary
      FSM support in iscsid(8), and improved logging and debug information.
    <li>uk(4) can now safely and reliably detach an unknown SCSI device.
    <li>mpath(4) device and kernel support is improved.
    <li>vscsi(4) now ensures output always goes to the correct connection.
    <li>vscsi(4) connections can now be reset gracefully.
    <li>scsi(4) devices on fibre channel fabrics no longer inherit the adapter's
      address.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>Assorted improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>For additional security, security(8) was rewritten in Perl.
    <li>Mandoc 1.11.4: Now accepts eqn(7) input (no fancy formatting yet)
      and supports -Tutf8 output (but no utf8 input yet).
    <li>Removed a variety of OS-compat emulation code, leaving just the Linux
      support.
    <li>Small improvements to Linux compat (only available on i386).
    <li>Improved our own pkg-config(1) implementation with extended comparison
      scheme and implementing various new options.
    <li>The math library, libm, was fully fleshed out to support all C99 required
      parts.  Many bugs for various architectures were fixed along the way.
    <li>malloc(3) is a lot faster and has a few further security features (more
      randomization, as well as the 'S' flag to enable all paranoia checks).
    <li>'make depend' is no longer neccessary in kernel compilation directories
      since the dependencies are calculated automatically.
    <li>Increased the default size of the buffer cache.
    <li>kqueue(2) now works on /dev/random and spliced sockets
    <li>On MBR-based disks, scan through up to 256 extended partition tables
      when looking for an OpenBSD partition table.
    <li>Added POSIX 2008 fdopendir(3) and openat(2) functions, as well as the
      O_CLOEXEC, O_DIRECTORY, and F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC flags.
    <li>Improved lint format string checks and added a few other checks.
    <li>kdump(8) now dumps stat and sockaddr structures, sysctl mib
      strings, and decodes syscall flags and operation bits.
    <li>Improved kernel pool debug checking.
    <li>Improved correctness of signals and various syscalls when rthreads
      are in use.
    <li>Kernel malloc(9) space and stacks moved to non-dma memory.
    <li>Fixed some shutdown/reboot hangs on NFS clients.
    <li>UNIX-domain socket paths are now guaranteed to be NUL-terminated.
    <li>Added support for *wprintf(3), wcs{,n}casecmp(3), and wcsdup(3).
    <li>NULL is now a (void *).
    </ul>
<p>

<li>Install/Upgrade process changes:
    <ul>
    <li>Completed support for DUID disk installs, and enabled it fully.
    <li>Tried to make sysmerge(8) work in the installer, but ran into small
      problems and decided to disable it.
    <li>Install non-free firmwares from the internet upon first boot, based on a
      question in the installer.
    <li>svnd(4)-like behaviour became the default for vnd(4) devices.  This is
      what is used to build the media.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>rc.d(8) framework improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>rc.d(8) is now also used the base system daemons.
    <li>Backward compatible with the historic way of starting daemons.
    <li>Notify the user by appending (ok) or (failed) in interactive mode.
    <li>Better diagnostics with the introduction of RC_DEBUG.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>OpenSSH 6.0:
    <ul>
    <li>New features:
      <ul>
      <li>Allow cancellation of port forwardings via the multiplexing socket
        (e.g. "ssh -O cancel -R 2222:127.0.0.1:22 user@host")
      <li>Add wildcard support to PermitOpen (e.g. "PermitOpen localhost:*")
      <li>A new "ssh-add -k" option to load only plain keys and not
        certificates into the agent.
      <li>ssh-add now supports loading keys from stdin ("program | ssh-add -")
      <li>Allow graceful shutdown of the multiplexing socket (stop listening,
        but don't interrupt existing connections), using "ssh -O stop".
      <li>"ssh-keygen -A" will now automatically generate host keys of every
        supported type
      <li>Deprecated GlobalKnownHostsFile2, UserKnownHostsFile2 and
        AuthorizedKeysFile2 options.  Instead, the corresponding
        GlobalKnownHostsFile UserKnownHostsFile and AuthorizedKeysFile
        options now all accept multiple arguments.
      <li>Add a RequestTTY option to ssh(1) to allow control over TTY
        requests similar to the -t/-tt/-T commandline options.
      <li>ssh_config(5) now supports negated host matching. E.g.
        "Host *.example.org !c.example.org" will match "a.example.org",
        "b.example.org", but not "c.example.org"
      <li>Add experimental systrace(4) sandboxing of pre-auth sshd(8),
        enabled using "UsePrivilegeSeparation=sandbox".
      <li>Add new SHA-2 based HMAC modes for the SSH transport layer from
        http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-dbider-sha2-mac-for-ssh-02.txt
      </ul>
    <li>The following significant bugs have been fixed in this release:
      <ul>
      <li>Fix hostbased authentication for hosts using ECDSA keys.
      <li>Fix corruption of file information in sftp(1)'s ls display.
      <li>Fix remote portforwarding with dynamically allocated listen ports.
      </ul>
    </ul>
<p>

<li>Over 7,200 ports, major robustness and speed improvements in package tools.
<li>Many pre-built packages for each architecture:

<h3><font color="#0000e0">How to install</font></h3>
<p>
Following this are the instructions which you would have on a piece of
paper if you had purchased a CDROM set instead of doing an alternate
form of install.  The instructions for doing an FTP (or other style
of) install are very similar; the CDROM instructions are left intact
so that you can see how much easier it would have been if you had
purchased a CDROM instead.
<p>

<p>
Quick installer information for people familiar with OpenBSD, and the
use of the "disklabel -E" command.  If you are at all confused when
installing OpenBSD, read the relevant INSTALL.* file as listed above!
<p>

<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/i386:</font></h3>
<ul>
Play with your BIOS options to enable booting from a CD. The OpenBSD/i386
release is on CD1. If your BIOS does not support booting from CD, you will need
to create a boot floppy to install from. To create a boot floppy write
<i>CD1:5.0/i386/floppy50.fs</i> to a floppy and boot via the floppy drive.

<p>
Use <i>CD1:5.0/i386/floppyB50.fs</i> instead for greater SCSI controller
support, or <i>CD1:5.0/i386/floppyC50.fs</i> for better laptop support.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD or a floppy disk,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in
the included INSTALL.i386 document.

<p>
If you are planning on dual booting OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.i386.

<p>
To make a boot floppy under MS-DOS, use the &quot;rawrite&quot; utility located
at <i>CD1:5.0/tools/rawrite.exe</i>. To make the boot floppy under a Unix OS,
use the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dd&amp;sektion=1">dd(1)</a>
utility. The following is an example usage of
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dd&amp;sektion=1">dd(1)</a>,
where the device could be &quot;floppy&quot;, &quot;rfd0c&quot;, or
&quot;rfd0a&quot;.

<ul><pre>
# <strong>dd if=&lt;file&gt; of=/dev/&lt;device&gt; bs=32k</strong>
</pre></ul>

<p>
Make sure you use properly formatted perfect floppies with NO BAD BLOCKS or
your install will most likely fail. For more information on creating a boot
floppy and installing OpenBSD/i386 please refer to
<a href="faq/faq4.html#MkFlop">FAQ 4.3.2</a>.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/amd64:</font></h3>
<ul>
The 5.0 release of OpenBSD/amd64 is located on CD2.
Boot from the CD to begin the install - you may need to adjust
your BIOS options first.
If you can't boot from the CD, you can create a boot floppy to install from.
To do this, write <i>CD2:5.0/amd64/floppy50.fs</i> to a floppy, then
boot from the floppy drive.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD or a floppy disk,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in the included
INSTALL.amd64 document.

<p>
If you are planning to dual boot OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.amd64.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/macppc:</font></h3>
<ul>
Put CD2 in your CDROM drive and poweron your machine while holding down the
<i>C</i> key until the display turns on and shows <i>OpenBSD/macppc boot</i>.

<p>
Alternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter <i>boot cd:,ofwboot
/5.0/macppc/bsd.rd</i>
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/sparc64:</font></h3>
<ul>
Put CD3 in your CDROM drive and type <i>boot cdrom</i>.

<p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>CD3:5.0/sparc64/floppy50.fs</i> or <i>CD3:5.0/sparc64/floppyB50.fs</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<p>
You can also write <i>CD3:5.0/sparc64/miniroot50.fs</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

<p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/alpha:</font></h3>
<ul>
<p>Write <i>FTP:5.0/alpha/floppy50.fs</i> or
<i>FTP:5.0/alpha/floppyB50.fs</i> (depending on your machine) to a diskette and
enter <i>boot dva0</i>. Refer to INSTALL.alpha for more details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/armish:</font></h3>
<ul>
<p>
After connecting a serial port, Thecus can boot directly from the network
either tftp or http. Configure the network using fconfig, reset,
then load bsd.rd, see INSTALL.armish for specific details.
IOData HDL-G can only boot from an EXT-2 partition. Boot into linux
and copy 'boot' and bsd.rd into the first partition on wd0 (hda1)

To install on an O2, burn cd50.iso on a CD-R, put it in the CD drive of your
machine and select <i>Install System Software</i> from the System Maintenance
menu.

<p>
On other systems, or if your machine doesn't have a CD drive, you can
setup a DHCP/tftp network server, and boot using "bootp()/bsd.rd.IP##" using
the kernel matching your system type.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.sgi for more details.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/socppc:</font></h3>
<ul>
<p>

Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.socppc for more details.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/sparc:</font></h3>
<ul>
Boot from one of the provided install ISO images, using one of the two
commands listed below, depending on the version of your ROM.

<ul><pre>
ok <strong>boot cdrom 5.0/sparc/bsd.rd</strong>
or
&gt; <strong>b sd(0,6,0)5.0/sparc/bsd.rd</strong>
</pre></ul>

<p>
If your SPARC system does not have a CD drive, you can alternatively boot from floppy.
To do so you need to write <i>floppy50.fs</i> to a floppy.
For more information see <a href="faq/faq4.html#MkFlop">FAQ 4.3.2</a>.
To boot from the floppy use one of the two commands listed below,
depending on the version of your ROM.

<ul><pre>
ok <strong>boot floppy</strong>
or
&gt; <strong>b fd()</strong>
</pre></ul>

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<p>
If your SPARC system doesn't have a floppy drive nor a CD drive, you can either
setup a bootable tape, or install via network, as told in the
INSTALL.sparc file.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/vax:</font></h3>
<ul>
Boot over the network via mopbooting as described in INSTALL.vax.

openbsd50_arm.ipk package.  Reboot, then run it.  Read INSTALL.zaurus
for a few important details.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">Notes about the source code:</font></h3>
<ul>
src.tar.gz contains a source archive starting at /usr/src.  This file
contains everything you need except for the kernel sources, which are
in a separate archive.  To extract:
<p>
<ul><pre>
# <strong>mkdir -p /usr/src</strong>
# <strong>cd /usr/src</strong>
# <strong>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</strong>
</pre></ul>
<p>
sys.tar.gz contains a source archive starting at /usr/src/sys.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
<p>
<ul><pre>
# <strong>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</strong>
# <strong>cd /usr/src</strong>
# <strong>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</strong>
</pre></ul>
<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.
<p>
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#0000e0">How to upgrade</font></h3>
<p>
If you already have an OpenBSD 4.9 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="faq/upgrade50.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.

<a name="ports"></a>
<hr>
<p>
<h3><font color="#0000e0">Ports Tree</font></h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
<p>
<ul><pre>
# <strong>cd /usr</strong>
# <strong>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</strong>
# <strong>cd ports</strong>
</pre></ul>
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> subdirectory is a checkout of the OpenBSD ports tree.  Go
read the <a href="faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS (see the manpage for
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=cvs&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386">
cvs(1)</a> if
you aren't familiar with CVS) checkout of our ports.  As with our complete
source tree, our ports tree is available via anoncvs.  So, in
order to keep current with it, you must make the <i>ports/</i> tree
available on a read-write medium and update the tree with a command
like:
<p>
<ul><pre>
# <strong>cd [portsdir]/; cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_4_9</strong>
</pre></ul>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the local directory and server name here
with the location of your ports collection and a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages through FTP. Updated
packages for the 5.0 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list ports@openbsd.org is a good
place to know.
