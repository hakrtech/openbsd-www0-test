    <li>Support for MSG_NOSIGNAL
    <li>KERN_PROC_CWD sysctl(3) for fetching the path to a process's working directory.
    <li>Improved fnmatch(3), glob(3), and regcomp(3) implementations to resist
        DoS attacks.
    <li>Lots of HISTORY and AUTHORS information added to manpages.
    <li>Improved checking of file-offset wraparound.
    <li>pwrite(2)/pwritev(2) now correctly by ignored O_APPEND.
    <li>Improved conformance of header files with standards.
    <li>Improved cancelation support in both user-threads (libpthread) and rthreads.
    <li>Improved correctness of execing, coredumping, signal delivery,
        alternate signal stacks, blocking socket accepts(), mutexes and
        condition variables, per-thread errno, symbol binding, and
        ktracing when rthreads are in use.
    <li>Architecture-independent kernel support for thread-control-block
        handling for rthreads.
    <li>Small improvements to Linux compat (only available on i386).
    </ul>
<p>
<li>Over 7,000 ports, major performance and stability improvements in 
the package build process
    <ul>
    <li>Downloading of distfiles is simpler, can resume interrupted download,
    discover file moves, and expire old files. Distfiles mirror sites now use
    the new and improved method.
    <li>Dependency handling during ports build and package creation is at least
    twice as fast, twenty times as fast in pathological cases. This also affects
    user scripts such as out-of-date
    <li>More checks are done during package builds, for increased user friendliness
    <li>The long term process of documenting the infrastructure is now 100% done.
    <li>The distributed ports builder (dpb) can now clean up old dependencies,
    thus helping package builds be more reproducible.
    This found tens of hidden build dependencies in the ports tree already.
    <li>The semantics of pkg_add -a have been nailed down and a few minor bugs
    have been fixed.
    <li>The arch-dependent issues are better classified, leading to better builds on
    old architectures in some complicated cases. In particular, dpb explicitly
    purges from memory info about packages it cannot build and stuff that 
    depends on it, leading to better life on sparc and vax which have very
    small data-size limits.
    <li>dpb recognizes full builds and trims some duplicate package builds
    </ul>
<p>
<li>Many pre-built packages for each architecture:

<h3><font color="#0000e0">How to install</font></h3>
<p>
Following this are the instructions which you would have on a piece of
paper if you had purchased a CDROM set instead of doing an alternate
form of install.  The instructions for doing an FTP (or other style
of) install are very similar; the CDROM instructions are left intact
so that you can see how much easier it would have been if you had
purchased a CDROM instead.

<p>
Quick installer information for people familiar with OpenBSD, and the
use of the "disklabel -E" command.  If you are at all confused when
installing OpenBSD, read the relevant INSTALL.* file as listed above!
<p>

<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/i386:</font></h3>
<ul>
Play with your BIOS options to enable booting from a CD. The OpenBSD/i386
release is on CD1. If your BIOS does not support booting from CD, you will need
to create a boot floppy to install from. To create a boot floppy write
<i>CD1:5.1/i386/floppy51.fs</i> to a floppy and boot via the floppy drive.

<p>
Use <i>CD1:5.1/i386/floppyB51.fs</i> instead for greater SCSI controller
support, or <i>CD1:5.1/i386/floppyC51.fs</i> for better laptop support.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD or a floppy disk,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in
the included INSTALL.i386 document.

<p>
If you are planning on dual booting OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.i386.

<p>
To make a boot floppy under MS-DOS, use the &quot;rawrite&quot; utility located
at <i>CD1:5.1/tools/rawrite.exe</i>. To make the boot floppy under a Unix OS,
use the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dd&amp;sektion=1">dd(1)</a>
utility. The following is an example usage of
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dd&amp;sektion=1">dd(1)</a>,
where the device could be &quot;floppy&quot;, &quot;rfd0c&quot;, or
&quot;rfd0a&quot;.

<ul><pre>
# <strong>dd if=&lt;file&gt; of=/dev/&lt;device&gt; bs=32k</strong>
</pre></ul>

<p>
Make sure you use properly formatted perfect floppies with NO BAD BLOCKS or
your install will most likely fail. For more information on creating a boot
floppy and installing OpenBSD/i386 please refer to
<a href="faq/faq4.html#MkFlop">FAQ 4.3.2</a>.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/amd64:</font></h3>
<ul>
The 5.1 release of OpenBSD/amd64 is located on CD2.
Boot from the CD to begin the install - you may need to adjust
your BIOS options first.
If you can't boot from the CD, you can create a boot floppy to install from.
To do this, write <i>CD2:5.1/amd64/floppy51.fs</i> to a floppy, then
boot from the floppy drive.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD or a floppy disk,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in the included
INSTALL.amd64 document.

<p>
If you are planning to dual boot OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.amd64.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/macppc:</font></h3>
<ul>
Put CD2 in your CDROM drive and poweron your machine while holding down the
<i>C</i> key until the display turns on and shows <i>OpenBSD/macppc boot</i>.

<p>
Alternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter <i>boot cd:,ofwboot
/5.1/macppc/bsd.rd</i>
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/sparc64:</font></h3>
<ul>
Put CD3 in your CDROM drive and type <i>boot cdrom</i>.

<p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>CD3:5.1/sparc64/floppy51.fs</i> or <i>CD3:5.1/sparc64/floppyB51.fs</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<p>
You can also write <i>CD3:5.1/sparc64/miniroot51.fs</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

<p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/alpha:</font></h3>
<ul>
<p>Write <i>FTP:5.1/alpha/floppy51.fs</i> or
<i>FTP:5.1/alpha/floppyB51.fs</i> (depending on your machine) to a diskette and
enter <i>boot dva0</i>. Refer to INSTALL.alpha for more details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/armish:</font></h3>
<ul>
<p>
After connecting a serial port, Thecus can boot directly from the network
either tftp or http. Configure the network using fconfig, reset,
then load bsd.rd, see INSTALL.armish for specific details.
IOData HDL-G can only boot from an EXT-2 partition. Boot into linux
and copy 'boot' and bsd.rd into the first partition on wd0 (hda1)
then load and run bsd.rd, preserving the wd0i (hda1) ext2fs partition.
More details are available in INSTALL.armish.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/hp300:</font></h3>

<p>
sys.tar.gz contains a source archive starting at /usr/src/sys.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
<p>
<ul><pre>
# <strong>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</strong>
# <strong>cd /usr/src</strong>
# <strong>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</strong>
</pre></ul>

Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.

If you already have an OpenBSD 5.0 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="faq/upgrade51.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.

A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:

<ul><pre>
# <strong>cd /usr</strong>
# <strong>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</strong>
# <strong>cd ports</strong>
</pre></ul>

The <i>ports/</i> subdirectory is a checkout of the OpenBSD ports tree.  Go
read the <a href="faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS (see the manpage for
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=cvs&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386">
cvs(1)</a> if
you aren't familiar with CVS) checkout of our ports.  As with our complete
source tree, our ports tree is available via anoncvs.  So, in
order to keep current with it, you must make the <i>ports/</i> tree
available on a read-write medium and update the tree with a command
like:
<p>
<ul><pre>
# <strong>cd [portsdir]/; cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_5_1</strong>
</pre></ul>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the local directory and server name here
with the location of your ports collection and a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages through FTP. Updated
packages for the 5.1 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list ports@openbsd.org is a good
place to know.
