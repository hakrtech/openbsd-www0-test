<h2><font color=#e00000>i386 Laptop Status</font><hr></h2>

<p>
This is a list of laptops known to be working with OpenBSD 2.6.

<p>
If your laptop isn't listed below that doesn't mean that it isn't working,
and you will most likely find a similar model that is listed below.  As of
OpenBSD 2.6, we know of no laptops that do not work minimally.  Of those that
have problems..
<ul>
<li>Some exhibit problems with APM support.  Note that <strong>apm -S</strong>
    fails to suspend some laptops, but this is not a major concern.
<li>Many lack sound support
<li>A few have subtle bugs with their PCMCIA support
<li>XFree86 does not support their displays properly
<li>Or some other built-in device doesn't work..
<li>Cardbus is not supported at all.  However, pcmcia works fine.
<li>Some have problems with pcmcia card eject interrupts.
</ul>

<p>
If you have your laptop working (or not working) and it isn't listed below,
please mail <a href="mailto:chris@openbsd.org">chris@openbsd.org</a> so that it
can be listed.  Please supply as much information as possible.

<p>
APM problem reports should be sent to our APM developers,
<a href=mailto:mickey@openbsd.org>Michael Shalayeff</a> and
<a href=mailto:weingart@openbsd.org>Tobias Weingartner</a>.

	APM support: "<strong>zzz</strong>", suspend via keyboard, hibernation
	via keyboard, and "<strong>halt -p</strong>" all work.
	"<strong>apm -S</strong>" wakes up immediately.<p>

	Hibernation uses a block at the end of the disk, approximately
	3-5MB larger than the memory in your machine.  To repair hibernation,
	use "<strong>phdisk.exe /create /partition</strong>" to setup the
	partition.  The phdisk program is available on the boot
	floppy image provided on the first recovery CD.<p>

	Built-in ethernet works fine, but requires reset after suspend using
	"<strong>ifconfig fxp0 down; ifconfig fxp0 up</strong>".<p>

	After a suspend, the profiling clock is not running.  Patches are
	being worked on.<p>

	Sound is not supported.<p>

	When the memory stick slot is empty, it can cause errors which overflow
	the dmesg buffer, and thus confuse the OpenBSD install program.
	The BIOS Setup, (accessed using F2), has an option to disable the
	memory stick.<p>

	Sound works (8 bit only).<p>

	APM behaviour similar to the VAIO z505r,
	except that hibernation has not been tested.<p>

	APM is completely broken.<p>

	The mixed <strong>sb</strong> and <strong>wss</strong> sound
	hardware can cause some grief.  Newer versions of the flash
	BIOS are worse, since they are less flexible about what interrupts
	they allow.<p>

	Dell Inspiron 3200 D233XT (Bios release: A10)
    </td><td>
	APM works fully.<p>

	Suspend (to ram or disk) does not work under X (X server does not
	restore screen upon resume), but DPMS do (screen is turned off after
	a while if the machine isn't used).  BIOS APM settings (for automatic
	suspend) interfere with X server, and should be disabled.<p>

	Suspend to disk needs a DOS (FAT16) partition containing a file named
	"SAVE2DSK.BIN".  This file which is created via Dell tools under
	Windows 98 (it's present out of factory), is sized (ram size + 2 or 3
	MB).  An ad hoc DOS partition is thus required (it must be the first
	partition on disk).<p>

	PCMCIA: works except "live" card ejection or insertion (which lock
	the machine, a hard reset is required).<p>

	USB: does not work, if enabled, kernel hangs at boot during USB
	controller detection.<p>
