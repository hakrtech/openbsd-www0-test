<h2><font color="#e00000">i386 Laptop Status</font></h2>
<hr>

<p> This is a list of laptops known to be working with OpenBSD.

<p> If your laptop isn't listed below doesn't mean that it won't work,
and you will most likely find a similar model that is listed below.
Most laptops work very well, however some will still have minor issues.

<p> Of those that have problems,
<ul>
<li>Some exhibit problems with APM support.  Note that <strong>apm -S</strong>
	fails to suspend some laptops.
<li>Some lack sound support
<li>A few have subtle bugs with their PCMCIA and CardBus support
<li>XFree86/X.org does not support some displays properly. Sometimes
	switching between both of them helps.
<li>Some other built-in device doesn't work.
<li>Some have problems with pcmcia card eject interrupts.
<li>Almost all modern laptops with on-board modems have "winmodems",
	which are not currently and are unlikely to ever be supported.
	Use a PCCard modem if you need one that works.  You can
	assume any modem on the machines below does NOT work unless
	indicated.
<li>IBM Thinkpads (and perhaps other notebooks, too) with Phoenix-style
	BIOSes offer a so-called "hibernation mode", where memory is
	written to disk. You can use this feature with OpenBSD.
	Generate the partition for hibernation using the
	<tt>/usr/ports/sysutils/tphdisk</tt> utility from the
	ports collection.
<li>IBM Thinkpads with mini-PCI slots can be forced to work with
	other cards than those supplied by the manufacturer by using
	the <tt>/usr/ports/misc/tpwireless</tt> utility from ports.
</ul>

<p>
If you have your laptop working (or not working) and it isn't listed below,
please mail <a href="mailto:www@openbsd.org">www@openbsd.org</a> so that it
can be listed.  Please supply as much information as possible.

	IBM Thinkpad X31
</td><td>
<p><ul>
	<li>Works with OpenBSD 3.7-current (April 2005).
	<li>Nearly all Hardware is supported, except FireWire.
	<li>APM is well supported. Suspend mode (apm -s/zzz) works without
	problems. Hibernation (suspend to disk) works also fine but
	requires a small MS-DOS partition with a hibernation file at the
	beginning of the harddisk. You can create this file with tphdisk
	from ports (/usr/ports/sysutils/tphdisk).

	<li>The two extra keys around the cursor block can be configured via
	xmodmap.
	<li>Example:

	<pre>
		xmodmap -e "keycode 233 = Page_Down"
		xmodmap -e "keycode 234 = Page_Up"
	</pre>

	<li>The integrated Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 in my X31 (Model 2672-C8G)
	works with the
	<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ipw&amp;sektion=4">ipw(4)</a>
	driver. But you need to download the unfree firmware first to get
	it working. For more details read
	<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ipw&amp;sektion=4#FILES">ipw(4)</a>.

	<li>I'm planning to replace this card with a
	<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ral&amp;sektion=4">ral(4)</a>
	or an
	<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ath&amp;sektion=4">ath(4)</a>.
	For these cards, no unfree firmware required. To replace it,
	I'll have to <i>unlock</i> the bios first because IBM allows only
	<i>special</i> IBM wireless cards to be installed. The bios can
	be patched with the tpwireless program
	(/usr/ports/misc/tpwireless, <b>use on your own risk!</b>).

	<li>The integrated CF-Card reader (really nice!) is supported
	as well.

	<li>Enhanced SpeedStep is supported. You can adjust the cpu speed
	via sysctl (<tt>sysctl hw.setperf</tt>).

	<li>The on-board
	<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fxp&amp;sektion=4">fxp(4)</a>
	and
	<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=auich&amp;sektion=4">auich(4)</a>
	are working without problems.

	<li>The keys for mute, volume up and volume down are working fine.
	No special software is required. If you'd like to get the big
	"Access IBM" button to work and have a nice on-screen display, you
	can install tpb from ports. (/usr/ports/sysutils/tpb) This works just
	fine and you have nice on-screen messages when you change volume and
	brightness settings or enable/disable the ThinkLight.

	<li>The use of other 802.11 cards may be restricted by the BIOS. 
         However, non-IBM supplied cards can be used after running the
	 <tt>/usr/ports/misc/tpwireless</tt> utility.
	<li>APM works fine, including suspend to hard-disk (hibernation)
	<li>If you want to use Hibernation, you must have a small
	msdos partition with a save2dsk.bin. For this, you can use

	<li>OpenBSD 3.6-current (as of August 2004) runs. Installation is
	cumbersome, though. The Sony CD drive does not boot the snapshot CD.
	<li>Installation by USB floppy:
	The floppy36.fs of the snapshot (august 2004)
	can be brought to boot if one disables the
	following (boot -c, wait for the UKC&gt; prompt):
	<pre>
	disable pcibios
	disable fxp
	disable pcic
	</pre>
	<li>After this there is no USB, no PCMCIA, no Cardbus
	and no network. This means that the laptop has
	no input/output! So you have to put the install sets
	on a partition from some other OS or earlier installations
	of OpenBSD. The install script can mount ffs and msdos
	partitions. The kernel as supplied with the snapshot
	boots alright and recognizes all the relevant hardware
	(no firewire, no memorystick, no JogDial).
	<li>Sound (yds) works. The XFConfig from the OpenBSD install
	works without modification.

	<li>OpenBSD 3.6 works, but there are some minor issues.
	<li>USB and built-in sound (Yamaha) work just fine.
	<li>My 3com Megahertz Cardbus LAN Card (xl) works ok.
	<li>Jog Dial and the mini camera were useless to me, so I never
	tested them.
	<li>While the GENERIC Kernel works fine, the installation ramdisk
	kernel hangs on booting since OpenBSD 3.3 or so. Disabling the
	cardslot and PCMCIA subsystem in UKC before booting makes the ramdisk
	come up, too. But then you have to install from images you left on
	the hard disk before (e. g. in a discardable filesystem in the
	partition you want to use for swapping later), because you can't
	access LAN or WLAN without the cardslot.
	<li>Removing cards from the PCMCIA/Cardbus slot on a running
	system may cause system freeze or instant reboot sometimes.
	<li>My D-Link DWL-650 (PrismII) works for some time, but then
	locks up and has to be reinserted to work again. This, however,
	causes the problems mentioned above.

	Toshiba Libretto 50CT
</td><td>
<p><ul>
	<li>APM works but you need to be careful not to use the last
	32meg or so of the disk since that's where the BIOS dumps
	the long time hibernation image. You can take a look at
	the bios geometry in disklabel to see exactly how many sectors
	it wants.  Failure to do so will cause filesystem corruption
	during suspend.
	<li>The libretto uses a single IRQ for both
	<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sb&amp;sektion=4&amp;arch=i386">sb(4)</a>
	and
	<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=wss&amp;sektion=4&amp;arch=i386">wss</a>
	so the best thing to do is to choose one and disable the other
	in the kernel.
	<li>The pcmcia external floppy drive is not currently supported
	by OpenBSD, but it can be used during the install.
	<li>Installation can be a bit tricky with only a single pcmcia
	slot.  The best way to do this is to do a network install.
	To do this, load the boot floppy and at the boot prompt,
	enter <em>boot -c</em>.  When you see the <em>UKC</em>
	prompt, unplug the floppy drive, plug in your network card,
	and then type exit.  The kernel will then probe the network
	card and you should be able to do a normal network install.
	You may find it necessary to disable the sound devices in
	the BIOS in order for the boot floppy to correctly detect
	your network card.
	<li>Note that the chips driver was broken in XFree86 4.1 (it
	is fixed in XFree86 4.2) and hence the XFree86 that ships
	with OpenBSD 3.0 does not work on the libretto.  I have
	compiled the old XFree86 4.01 chips driver (which does work)
	for XFree86 4.1.  Just grab
	<a href="ftp://ftp.courtesan.com/pub/todd/OpenBSD/chips_drv.o">
	chips_drv.o</a> and copy it to
	<pre>
		/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/drivers/chips_drv.o
	</pre>
	That will make XFree86 4.1 work on the 50CT and 70CT.
