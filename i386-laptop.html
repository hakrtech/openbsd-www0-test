<hr>

<p>
This is a list of laptops known to be working with OpenBSD 2.9

<p>
If your laptop isn't listed below that doesn't mean that it won't work,
and you will most likely find a similar model that is listed below.  Starting
with OpenBSD 2.6, almost all laptops worked very well, with only minimal
issues remaining.  Later OpenBSD releases perform even better.
<p>
Of those that have problems..
<ul>
<li>Some exhibit problems with APM support.  Note that <strong>apm -S</strong>
    fails to suspend some laptops, but this is not a major concern.
<li>Some lack sound support
<li>A few have subtle bugs with their PCMCIA and Cardbus support
<li>XFree86 does not support some displays properly.  Sometimes XFree86 4.x helps.
<li>Or some other built-in device doesn't work..
<li>Some have problems with pcmcia card eject interrupts.
</ul>

<p>
If you have your laptop working (or not working) and it isn't listed below,
please mail <a href="mailto:www@openbsd.org">www@openbsd.org</a> so that it
can be listed.  Please supply as much information as possible.

<p>
APM problem reports should be sent to our APM developers,
<a href="mailto:mickey@openbsd.org">Michael Shalayeff</a> and

	Suspend (to ram or disk) does not work under X (X server does not

	suspend) interfere with X server, and should be disabled.<p>

	Suspend to disk needs a DOS (FAT16) partition containing a file named
	"SAVE2DSK.BIN".  This file which is created via Dell tools under
	Windows 98 (it's present out of factory), is sized (ram size + 2 or 3
	MB).  An ad hoc DOS partition is thus required (it must be the first
	partition on disk).<p>

	PCMCIA: works except "live" card ejection or insertion (which lock
	the machine, a hard reset is required).<p>

	USB: does not work, if enabled, kernel hangs at boot during USB

	<p>As of OpenBSD 2.8, almost everything works fine.</p>

	<p>This laptop does not really have a BIOS; most of the device
	settings, like IRQ assignments etc. have to be done through
	Windows.</p>

	<p>You can get the serial and infrared ports to be recognized
	as com* devices by playing with the IRQ assignments in
	Windows. Likewise for the parallel port (it's lpt2).</p>

	<p>You will need this line in your kernel configuration file for
	APM to work at all:</p>

<pre>
option         APM_DISABLE_INTERRUPTS=0
</pre>

        <p>Hibernation (save to disk) works fine as long as you have a
        Windows partition with enough disk space (a bit more than the
        system memory). Suspend/resume/powerdown all work fine;
        however, doing hibernation while in X Window System (tested in
        XFree86 3.3.6) causes framebuffer corruption and it seems that
        the only way to recover is to exit and restart the X server;
        switching virtual terminals doesn't fix it. It has been
        suggested that switching between different resolutions might
        fix it. XFree86 4.0 fixes that problem, but last I checked did
        not have accelerated support for the driver. The best
        work-around is to switch to text mode before hibernating.</p>

	<p>If you enable the external monitor (Fn+F7), XFree86 3.3.6
	goes into some weird rainbow pattern and eventually freezes
	the system (unless you switch to text mode or otherwise kill
	the server within a few seconds); if you switch to text mode,
	you have to kill the X server (switching back to graphics mode
	will cause a crash). Enabling the external monitor while in
	video mode causes no side effects; you can then start X or
	switch to it if it's already running.</p>

	<p>The <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=clcs&amp;sektion=4">clcs(4)</a> driver is somewhat flakey, so you're best off
	disabling it.  It doesn't really matter though since the
	soundblaster (<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sb&amp;sektion=4%2fi386&amp;apropos=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Curren&amp;arch=i386">sb(4)</a>) will attach and work fine. You may have to play with IRQ assignments
	to get that to work.</p>

	2.8 post mid-December with XFree86 4.0.2 works great at
	1600x1200 24bpp. You need to:

    	<p>On my model, most things work fine with OpenBSD 3.1 and later. </p>
	<p>Beware that IBM does ship variations of the basic model, though.</p>
	<p>The usual setup as other Thinkpad models is required if one wishes
	to keep Windows around. As usual, multibooting Windows NT works. I
	have kept the restore partition around for now, and I recommend 
	burning the recovery partition to CD, as a backup. </p>
	<p>The video card (ATI Radeon Mobility) needs to be told explicitly 
	to run in 1600x1200 (which is just a two line addition to XF86Config).  
	Sometimes, X doesn't start correctly, and needs to be killed and 
	restarted.
	The XVideo extension works, so DVDs can be run full-screen with ogle. 
	In -current, mplayer can display most other kinds of video as well.</p>
	<p>Sound works.  The integrated Ethernet card works. 
	The integrated Prism WiFi works.  Suspend works.  
	The special keys (sound volume, light intensity...) are handled 
	by the hardware and work under OpenBSD as well.
	The CD Burner works.</p>
	<p>IDE dma is not recognized in 3.1, as the chipset is a new revision 
	of the Intel 82801. This was fixed right after I got the laptop.  
	I haven't even tried to get the modem or the infrared working.</p>

	<p>As of OpenBSD 2.8, everything works fine.</p>

       <p>Here is the fdisk output; the easiest way of getting there is
       to resize the Windows partition (I use PartitionMagic) and move
       it to the end of the disk, then create an OpenBSD partition
       (and ignore the partition resizing fdisk does -- just go ahead
       and create all the filesystems you need with disklabel).</p>

	<p>To get it to see the serial and infrared ports (both as com*
	devices), you need to play with the IRQ assignments in the
	BIOS; just set them to the default values as found in the
	GENERIC config file. Likewise for the parallel port (OpenBSD
	can see lpt2). You may have to play with the Windows
	assignments for this as well.</p>

	<p>There's at least two miniPCI cards available at this point:
	one is an (unsupported) WinModem, and the other is a combo
	ethernet/modem card. The ethernet works just fine (detected
	as an fxp/inphy card); the modem looks like it's a real one,
	but it's not yet supported.</p>

	<p>Sound (CS4614) works fine. To avoid system freeze when using
	Cardbus and audio simultaneously, you *may* need to set at least
        two IRQs for use by PCI devices, in the BIOS; I use 9 and 11. It
	is also necessary to turn off PCI Power Management in the BIOS
	Power configuration (that's the only menu that scrolls, so make
	sure you go to the bottom of the page :-)</p>

	<p>APM works except for hibernation (requires OS support). To
	get "halt -p" to work, you must set the sysctl variable
	machdep.apmhalt to 1 (you need OpenBSD 2.8-current with
	sources from mid-January, or later).  You will need this line
        in your kernel configuration file for APM to work at all:</p>

<pre>
option         APM_DISABLE_INTERRUPTS=0
</pre>

	<p>Although the video card is supposed to work with XFree86
	3.3.6pl8, I've only managed to get it to work with XFree86
	4.0.1 with the patches found <a
	href="http://www.probo.com/timr/savagemx.html">here</a> (you
	can also find binaries of the driver for OpenBSD 2.8 at the
	same location). You need to have a kernel with "option
	INSECURE" and set the securelevel to -1 in /etc/rc.securelevel
	(so the X server can open /dev/mem and mmap() the BIOS). In
	this configuration, it can do 1400x1050 at 16bpp (version 1.1.13
	of the savage driver works fine at 24bpp as well).</p>

	<p><b>UPDATE:</b> The above-mentioned patches have been
	included in XFree86 4.0.2, and work out of the box. You don'
	need a kernel with the option INSECURE set, just set the
	machdep.allowaperture sysctl variable to 2, typically in
	/etc/sysctl.conf, if you have an OpenBSD 2.8 (or later) built
        from sources updated after December 15th 2000.</p>

	<p>Note that some models only do 1024x768. Those that do
	1400x1050, can also do 1600x1200 using a virtual screen
	(wherein the whole display shifts as you go "off-screen"); I
	have not tested whether that works (it does in Windows).</p>

	<p>If you close the lid of the laptop, the system suspends;
	under XFree86 4.0, resuming works fine with respect to the
	display (XFree86 3.3.6 might not be able to cope with this --
	it couldn't on the ThinkPad 770Z).</p>

	<p>An XF86Config file for XFree86 4.0 can be found <a
	href="xf86configs/thinkpadt21">here</a>.</p>

	<p><b>UPDATE</b> Apparently, recent T21s have the ATI Rage
	3D Rage Mobility instead.

	<p>One annoying thing is when you take out one of the UltraBay
	2000 devices; the system starts beeping. The only way to make it
	stop is to suspend and then plug in a device in the UltraBay (not
	necessarily the same one). Note that hot-swap of UltraBay 2000
	devices is not currently supported in OpenBSD (as of 2.8), thus
	it's only safe to hot-swap batteries.</p>

	APM works but you need to be careful not to use the last
	32meg or so of the disk since that's where the BIOS dumps
	the long time hibernation image.  You can take a look at
	the bios geometry in disklabel to see exactly how many sectors
	it wants.  Failure to do so will cause filesystem corruption
	during suspend.
	<p>
        The libretto uses a single IRQ for both
	<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sb&amp;sektion=4%2fi386&amp;apropos=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386">sb(4)</a>
        and <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=wss&amp;sektion=4%2fi386&amp;apropos=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386">wss</a>
	so the best thing to do is to choose one and disable the other
	in the kernel.
	The pcmcia external floppy drive is not currently supported
	by OpenBSD, but it can be used during the install.
	<p>
        Installation can be a bit tricky with only a single pcmcia
        slot.  The best way to do this is to do a network install.
        To do this, load the boot floppy and at the boot prompt,
        enter <em>boot -c</em>.  When you see the <em>UKC</em>
        prompt, unplug the floppy drive, plug in your network card,
        and then type exit.  The kernel will then probe the network
        card and you should be able to do a normal network install.
	You may find it necessary to disable the sound devices in
	the BIOS in order for the boot floppy to correctly detect
	your network card.
	<p>
	There are sample XF86Config files for both
	<a href="xf86configs/libretto50ct">XFree86 4.X</a> and
	<a href="xf86configs/libretto50ct-xf3">XFree86 3.3.X</a>.
	<p>
        Note that the chips driver was broken in XFree86 4.1 (it
        is fixed in XFree86 4.2) and hence the XFree86 that ships
        with OpenBSD 3.0 does not work on the libretto.  I have
        compiled the old XFree86 4.01 chips driver (which does work)
        for XFree86 4.1.  Just grab <a
        href="ftp://ftp.courtesan.com/pub/todd/OpenBSD/chips_drv.o">
        chips_drv.o</a> and copy it to
        <pre>
	    /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/drivers/chips_drv.o
	</pre>
	That will make XFree86 4.1 work on the 50CT and 70CT.
