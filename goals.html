<h2>Project Goals</h2>

<p>
Each person working on OpenBSD has their own aims and priorities,
but the goals of project as a whole are to:
<ul>
<li>Provide the best development platform possible - with full source access
    for developers and users.
<li>Work towards a machine independent source tree.
<li>Pay attention to security problems and fix them.
<li>Work towards greater integration of cryptographic software where
	possible.  This means IPsec, IPv6, key engines, and other forms
	of strong crypto.  OpenBSD is from Canada and may export crypto
	as
	<a href=http://insight.mcmaster.ca/org/efc/pages/doc/crypto-export.html>
	researched by a Canadian individual</a> and as
	<a href=http://axion.physics.ubc.ca/ECL.html>
	layed out in the Export Control list of Canada</a>.
<li>Track and implement standards (POSIX, parts of X/Open, etc.)
<li>Support as many different systems and hardware as feasible.
<li>Be as politics free as possible - solutions should be decided on the
    basis of technical merit.
<li>Provide a good cross compile/development platform.
<li>Integrate good code from any source with acceptable copyright
    (Berkeley style preferred, GPL acceptable, NDA not).
<li>Import external packages with minimal modifications - making upgrading
    much easier. Also to submit back to the developers any changes made.
</ul>
