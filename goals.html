<h1>OpenBSD project goals</h1>

<p>
Each person working on OpenBSD has their own aims and priorities,
but the goals of project as a whole are to:
<ul>
<li>Provide the best development platform possible - with full source access
    for developers and users
<li>Work towards a machine independent source tree.
<li>Support as many different systems and hardware as feasible.
<li>Be as politics free as possible - solutions should be decided on the
    basis of technical merit.
<li>Provide a good cross compile/development platform.
<li>Integrate good code from any source with acceptable copyright
    (Berkeley style preferred, GPL acceptable, NDA not).
<li>Import external packages with minimal modifications - making upgrading
    much easier. Also to submit back to the developers any changes made.
</ul>
