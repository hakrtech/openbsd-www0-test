OpenBSD/sparc runs on most of the 32bit Sun SPARC workstations, including
the sun4, sun4c, and sun4m architectures
(not the 64bit UltraSPARC computers which are supported by
<a href="sparc64.html">OpenBSD/sparc64</a>).
The current port maintainer is
Art Grabowski (<a href="mailto:art@openbsd.org">art@openbsd.org</a>).
Others are definitely welcome to contribute!

<h3><font color=#0000e0><strong>History:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
The original BSD4.4 port was done by Chris Torek as a contract to
LBL. The code was released by Chris in mid-1993, and Theo de Raadt
worked it into shape for the NetBSD tree.  Theo and Markus Wild worked
on improving Chris' original SunOS compatibility code into a highly
complete and reliable emulation. Chuck Cranor ported the sun4c code to
the 8KB pagesized Sun4 architecture, and Theo merged this code in a
way that would allow the same kernel and programs to run on either
sun4c or sun4 machines (unlike Sun's separate kernel environments).
This last change also required a rewrite of the device configuration
code.  Just after the NetBSD/sparc 1.0 release, Peter Galbavy wrote an
ESP scsi device driver as a replacement for Chris' sparc-specific scsi
code, this new driver unfortunately had some problems and was eventually
replaced.
</p>

<p>
At this point a conflict emerged between Theo and the other people he
started the NetBSD project with, and Theo was forced by the core group
to resign from NetBSD.  After Theo left NetBSD, a few people in the
NetBSD group did some other things for the port: Paul Kranenburg
ported a floppy driver and started writing support for the 4/400.
Chuck spent many long hours working on the ie, xy, xd device drivers.
</p>

<p>
Theo continued working independently, and made a number of additions:
P4 support, flexible boot strategy, a few graphics drivers with help
from John Stone, and masses of bug fixes.  Many people will be most
interested that the ESP scsi driver has been completely replaced by
Theo, and that it supports disconnect/reconnect.
</p>

<p>
Work on porting OpenBSD/sparc to the sun4m platform was started by Theo,
but tendinitis problems with his wrists and the problems with the NetBSD
core conspired, and he stopped work.  Theo passed his initial sun4m work 
to Aaron Brown of Harvard, who was paid out of Margo Seltzer's research
funds.  This initial stuff consisted mostly of a few attempts at building
pmap structure that could support all 3 MMU types efficiently.  Also,
David Miller of the S/Linux project got a little bit involved.
</p>

<p>
Theo and Jason Downs merged the NetBSD sparc code back into OpenBSD, making
OpenBSD/sparc usable again.  Jason Wright wrote a few new SBus Ethernet
drivers with information from the S/Linux project and has merged a few bits
from NetBSD sources to improve the stability of this architecture.
</p>

<p>
And work continues...

<p>
An important note about OpenBSD/sparc is that it is designed so that
a single kernel can run on <b>ALL SUPPORTED</b> sparc machines.  Whereas
SunOS and Solaris have always had separate `kernel architectures', i.e. sun4,
sun4c, and sun4m, the same `GENERIC' OpenBSD kernel will run on all the
supported models. 
</p>

<p>
Most of the problems with OpenBSD/sparc are believed to stem from the wide
variety of sparc processor and cache implementations along with their
undocumented bugs, rather then general kernel problems.
Feedback on which models do and do not work reliably is
appreciated, particularly with newer models or upgrades.
</p>

<p>
OpenBSD/sparc can be installed or upgraded via floppy boot images on
sun4c and sun4m, miniroot images for machines without floppies
(and sun4 machines), as well as network and diskless installs.

<h4>OpenBSD/sparc does *not* run on these machines (yet):</h4>
<ul>
 <li> sun4: 4/400 (lacks support for the I/O cache, and has Ethernet problems)
 <li> sun4d machines<br>
      SPARC Server 1000<br>
      SPARC Center 2000<br>
      These machines use XD-Bus instead of M-Bus for their CPUs, and we do
      not support that yet.
 <li> sun4u: UltraSPARC 64-bit machines.  Some of these are supported in the
      <a href="sparc64.html">OpenBSD/sparc64</a> port.
 <li> It does not work on most Solbourne machines, which are quite different.
      (However, it works on the sun4c/sun4m compatible machines.)
</ul>

<h4>Unsupported Devices. First of all, there are MANY unsupported devices.
A comprehensive list can probably not be written.</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong> Serial Cards:</strong>
  <ul>
   <li> VME mti 16-port serial card
   <li> VME alm2 16-port serial card
   <li> VME mcp 4-port serial card (or is it 8 port)
  </ul>

<li><strong>Disk Controllers:</strong>
  <ul>
   <li> VME "sc" SCSI controller
   <li> VME IPI controller
  </ul>
 
<li><strong> Framebuffers:</strong>
  <ul>
   <li> VME cgfive, 8-bit color, 1-bit overlay, double-buffered,
	unaccelerated without GP/GP2
   <li> VME cgnine, 24-bit color, 1-bit overlay, double-buffered,
	unaccelerated without GP/GP2
   <li> VME GP/GP2 Graphics Processor (drives a cgfive or cgnine)
   <li> SBus cgeight 24-bit color, unaccelerated
	(note: SBus cgeight is quite different from VME/P4 cgeight)
   <li> SBus GS, 24-bit color, 8-bit color, overlay planes, double-buffered,
	3-D acceleration (aka cgtwelve) 
   <li> SBus GT, 24-bit color, 8-bit color, overlay planes, double-buffered,
	3-D acceleration (aka Graphics Tower)
   <li> SBus ZX, 24-bit color, 8-bit color, overlay planes, double-buffered,
	3-D acceleration (aka Leo)
  </ul>
<p>

<li><strong>On-board Audio and ISDN</strong><br>
    This is present on some sun4m systems (LX, LC, SPARCstation 10/20).
<p>
<li><strong>Multiple Processors/Modules in sun4m systems</strong><br>
    OpenBSD will not currently boot on some machines with multiple processors.
    You must remove the extra CPUs.
<p>
<li><strong>SBUS SUNW,bpp (parallel port)</strong><br>
    A driver exists in the source tree, but it does not work.  None of the
    developers have printers or cables to work with, to make it work, but
    we really would prefer to receive a fixed driver.
<p>
<li><strong>SBUS FAS scsi controllers</strong><br>
    The FAS-only card is not supported.  The HME+FAS card only supports the
    HME part of the card.
<p>
<li><strong>SBUS FDDI cards</strong><br>
<p>
<li><strong>Tadpole PCMCIA bridge</strong>
<p>
<li><strong>SBus cards other those listed above...</strong>
