OpenBSD/sparc runs on most of the 32bit Sun SPARC workstations, including
the sun4, sun4c, and sun4m architectures
(not the 64bit <a href="sparc64.html">Ultra SPARC</a> computers).
The current port maintainer is
Jason Wright (<a href="mailto:jason@openbsd.org">jason@openbsd.org</a>).
Others are definitely welcome to contribute!

<h3><font color=#0000e0><strong>History:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
The original BSD4.4 port was done by Chris Torek as a contract to
LBL. The code was released by Chris in mid-1993, and Theo de Raadt
worked it into shape for the NetBSD tree.  Theo and Markus Wild worked
on improving Chris' original SunOS compatibility code into a highly
complete and reliable emulation. Chuck Cranor ported the sun4c code to
the 8KB pagesized Sun4 architecture, and Theo merged this code in a
way that would allow the same kernel and programs to run on either
sun4c or sun4 machines (unlike Sun's separate kernel environments).
This last change also required a rewrite of the device configuration
code.  Just after the NetBSD/sparc 1.0 release, Peter Galbavy wrote an
ESP scsi device driver as a replacement for Chris' sparc-specific scsi
code, this new driver unfortunately had some problems and was eventually
replaced.
</p>

<p>
At this point a conflict emerged between Theo and the other people he
started the NetBSD project with, and Theo was forced by the core group
to resign from NetBSD.  After Theo left NetBSD, a few people in the
NetBSD group did some other things for the port: Paul Kranenburg
ported a floppy driver and started writing support for the 4/400.
Chuck spent many long hours working on the ie, xy, xd device drivers.
</p>

<p>
Theo continued working independently, and made a number of additions:
P4 support, flexible boot strategy, a few graphics drivers with help
from John Stone, and masses of bug fixes.  Many people will be most
interested that the ESP scsi driver has been completely replaced by
Theo, and that it supports disconnect/reconnect.
</p>

<p>
Work on porting OpenBSD/sparc to the sun4m platform was started by Theo,
but tendinitis problems with his wrists and the problems with the NetBSD
core conspired, and he stopped work.  Theo passed his initial sun4m work 
to Aaron Brown of Harvard, who was paid out of Margo Seltzer's research
funds.  This initial stuff consisted mostly of a few attempts at building
pmap structure that could support all 3 MMU types efficiently.  Also,
David Miller of the S/Linux project got a little bit involved.
</p>

<p>
Theo and Jason Downs merged the NetBSD sparc code back into OpenBSD, making
OpenBSD/sparc usable again.  Jason Wright wrote a few new SBus Ethernet
drivers with information from the S/Linux project and has merged a few bits
from NetBSD sources to improve the stability of this architecture.
</p>

<p>
And work continues...

Jason Wright, Theo de Raadt, and Todd Fries.

</p>

<p>
An important note about OpenBSD/sparc is that it is designed so that
a single kernel can run on <b>ALL SUPPORTED</b> sparc machines.  Whereas
SunOS and Solaris have always had separate `kernel architectures', ie. sun4,
sun4c, and sun4m, the same `GENERIC' OpenBSD kernel will run on all the
supported models. 
</p>

<p>
Most of the problems with OpenBSD/sparc are believed to stem from the wide
variety of sparc processor and cache implementations along with their
undocumented bugs, rather then general kernel problems.
Feedback on which models do and do not work reliably is
appreciated, particularly with the newer sun4m implementations like the
Fujitsu TurboSparc and Ross HyperSparc based systems and upgrades.
</p>

<p>
The installation tools and process as of the 2.1 release are greatly
improved over previous releases of OpenBSD, and more work has been done
with each successive release.  OpenBSD/sparc can be installed
or upgraded via floppy boot images on sun4c and sun4m, miniroot images 
for machines without floppies (and sun4 machines), as well as network
and diskless installs.

<h4>OpenBSD/sparc runs on the following classes of machines:</h4>
<ul>
<li> sun4: the VME series
	<ul>

	    In other respects, it is quite similar to the SSS1+.
	</ul>
<p>
<li> sun4c: 
	<ul>
	<li>SS1: the original 20MHz sun4c
	<li>SS1+: 25MHz version of the above

	of the slots of an SS1 or SS1+</strong>.
<p>
<li> sun4m: 
	<ul>
	<li>600MP:  The original Sun4m machine.  This is a mbus machine
	    with SBUS and VME machine.

	<li>LX: LC with a few more devices
	<li>SS5: MicroSPARC-2 based machines available in 60, 70,
	    85, 110, and 170 MHz versions
	<li>SS4: Reduced cost version of the SS5, only available at 110MHz
	<li>SS10: Pizzabox mbus-based machine.  See below for 
	<li>SS20: Improved Pizzabox mbus-based machine
	<li>CPU5V by Force Computer
	<li>SPARCbook 3GX and 3GS by Tadpole.
	</ul>
	<p>
	A few cpu combinations do not work reliably, as well as a few odd
	memory configurations.
<p>
<li> Typically it works on faithful clones of these machine.
</ul>

<h4>Supported devices</h4>

<p> This list of basically declares that any `stock' sun4c or sun4m
"sparcstation" or "sparcserver" machine will probably work; for sun4 machines
one must be more careful.

<h4>OpenBSD/sparc does *not* run on these machines (yet):</h4>
<ul>
 <li> sun4: 4/400 (lacks support for the I/O cache, and has Ethernet problems)
 <li> sun4m: older systems with Viking (TMS390Z55) processor modules
	without external cache chips, aka SuperCache, aka MXCC, aka PAC.
 <li> sun4m: with Ross HyperSparc processor modules
 <li> sun4d: SPARC Server 1000, SPARC Center 2000 -- XD-Bus vs. M-Bus,
	MP issues.
 <li> sun4u (<a href="sparc64.html">sparc64</a>): UltraSPARC 64-bit machines.
 <li> It does not work on most Solbourne machines, which are quite different.
</ul>

<p>
OpenBSD/sparc on the 4c/4m machines is critically dependent on configuration
information returned by the OpenBoot PROM.  A sparc clone that differs
substantially from the Sun model as far as device names and properties will
require additional work in this area.
