<h2><font color=#e00000>Project Goals</font><hr></h2>

Our goal is simple: Since telnet and rlogin are insecure, all
operating systems should ship with ssh included.  (See the picture
below).
<p>

SSH comes in two varieties.  The older protocol 1 comes in two major
variants: protocol 1.3 and protocol 1.5.  Both are supported by
OpenSSH.  Both of these use the asymmetric cryptography algorithm
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rsa">RSA</a>
(for which the USA patent has expired, allowing full use by everyone)
for key negotiation, and then use a
short list of symmetric algorithms for data hiding: 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=des_crypt">3DES</a>
and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=blowfish">Blowfish</a>
(there used to be a few others, but they had security
problems).  Some ssh 1 implementations also include the IDEA symmetric
algorithm, but because it is patented in some nations, and because the
other two supplied algorithms are sufficient, OpenSSH ships without it.
<p>

SSH protocol 1 uses a simple CRC for data integrity, which turns out
to be flawed; an insertion attack is known to be possible, however due
to a number of bandaids which have been applied to ssh over the years,
attacks against it are very difficult to perform.  When the 3DES cipher is
used, the insertion attack is not possible.
<p>

The other SSH variety is protocol 2.  Protocol 2 was invented to avoid
the patent issues regarding RSA (patent issues which no longer apply, since
the patent has expired), and to fix the CRC data integrity
problem that SSH1 has.  By using the asymmetric
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dsa">DSA</a>
and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dh">DH</a>
algorithms,
protocol 2 avoids all patents.  The CRC problem is also solved by
using a real
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=HMAC">HMAC</a>
algorithm.
<p>

OpenSSH code including full protocol 1.3 and 1.5 support shipped on
December 1, 1999.
<p>

For many it's cryptography features, OpenSSH relies on the non-GPL'd
<a href="http://www.openssl.org">OpenSSL</a> library.
<p>

Almost immediately after we shipped our protocol 1 implementation,
various non-OpenBSD groups got very, very interested.  Damien Miller,
Philip Hands, and handful of others started porting OpenSSH to Linux
and various other Unix operating systems.  From the start of our own
efforts, we have felt that even the original ssh code was too
complicated, it simply had too many operating system dependencies to
deal with.  Our approach to writing completely secure and rock solid
code avoids dealing with excessive differences like that.  Thus, to
make the entire development process easier on us all, we decided to
split our core development efforts from portability developments.
This has worked out very well for us.  (As a case in point, compare the
number of lines of code between the baseline and portable versions).
<p>

Since then, the OpenBSD project members who work on
OpenSSH have been making a push at supporting protocol 2 as well.  As
of May 4, 2000, protocol 2 is completely implemented.
<p>

So, as of May 4, 2000, OpenSSH provides full protocol 2 support.  But
since protocol 1 clients and servers are still more popular on the
Internet, we also continue to support protocol 1.
