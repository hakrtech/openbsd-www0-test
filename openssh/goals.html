<h2><font color=#e00000>Project Goals</font><hr></h2>

Our goal is simple: Operating systems should ship with ssh included.
<p>

In under a year, the RSA patent in the USA will expire.  In the meantime,
of course, people outside the USA are already allowed to use RSA patented
code in their software.  So we have a very large testing ground for
getting this wonderful public key cryptography fully integrated into our
operating system.
<p>

By the time the patent expires, OpenBSD will be ready to provide
people with tools that use that technology, throughout the operating
system.  OpenSSH is just a small part of that; for more information
see
