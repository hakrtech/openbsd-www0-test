OpenSSH is developed with the same rigorous security process that the
OpenBSD group is famous for.
<p>

For more information, see the
<a href=http://www.openbsd.org/security.html>OpenBSD Security page</a>.

<li>OpenSSH was not vulnerable to the RC4 cipher
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/565052">password cracking</a>,
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/665372">replay</a>, or
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/25309">modification</a>
    attacks.  At the time that OpenSSH was started, it was known at the
    time that SSH 1 used the RC4 stream cipher completely incorrectly,
    and thus RC4 support was removed.
<p>
<li>OpenSSH was not vulnerable to
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/684820">client forwarding attacks</a>
    in unencrypted connections, since unencrypted connection support was
    removed at OpenSSH project start.
<p>
<li>OpenSSH was not vulnerable to IDEA-encryption algorithm
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/315308">attacks on the last packet</a>,
    since the IDEA algorithm is not supported.  The patent status of IDEA makes
    it unsuitable for inclusion in OpenSSH.
<p>
<li>OpenSSH does not treat localhost as exempt from host key checking,
    thus making it not vulnerable to the
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/786900">host key authentication bypass</a>
    attack.
<p>
<li>OpenSSH was not vulnerable to
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/118892">uncontrollable X11 forwarding</a>
    attacks since the user can de-permit X11 forwarding.
<p>
<li>OpenSSH has the SSH 1 protocol defficiency that might make an insertion attack
    difficult but possible.  The CORE-SDI
    <a href="http://www.core-sdi.com/soft/ssh/ssh-advisory.txt">deattack mechanism</a>
    is used to eliminate
    the common case. Ways of solving this problem are being investigated, since
    the SSH 1 protocol is not dead yet.
<p>
<li>OpenSSH was not vulnerable to the
    "Feb 5, 2001: SSH-1 Brute Force Password Vulnerability",
    <a href="http://www.crimelabs.net">Crimelabs Security Note CLABS200101</a>.
