<h2><font color=#e00000>Unix Alternatives</font><hr></h2>

If you choose not to use OpenSSH on Unix, the following "free" clients are
available for interoperating with OpenSSH:<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.pdc.kth.se/pub/krypto/ossh/">OSSH</a>
is an SSH1-only implementation. BSD Licence.
<p>

Bj&ouml;rn Gr&ouml;nvall was the original person to remind our
community that very old versions of the real ssh had a free licence.
This is his own implementation, based on the old Tatu code.
OpenSSH was based on an early version of OSSH, but OpenSSH added
SSH2 and extended the SSH1 protocol support.
<p>

<li><a href="http://www.net.lut.ac.uk/psst/">LSH/psst</a>
is an SSH2-only implementation, by Niels M&ouml;ller in Sweden,
GPL Licence.
<p>

"ssh uses cryptographic techniques to enhance the security of everyday
distributed computing tasks such as file transfers, remote logins and
remote command execution. It's intended as a (more) secure alternative
to the likes of telnet, ftp, rsh, rlogin and rexec - and one which
requires much less effort to set up than Kerberos or IPSEC currently
do."
<p>

<li><a href="http://www.fressh.org/">FreSSH</a>
is an SSH1-only implementation, originally written by Eric
Haszlakiewicz and Thor Lancelot Simon, and currently developed by Jason
R. Thorpe.  The licence is BSD like, however it should be read
carefully as it contains software developed by other parties and under
a different licence.
<p>

From its web site:
&quot;FreSSH is a free implementation of the SSH communication
protocol. It is compact, modular, portable, and designed for security
and performance. It is a completely new implementation sharing no code
with any other implementation of the SSH communication protocol. It is
provided under a BSD-style license which permits redistribution in
source or binary form.  FreSSH currently implements SSH protocol
version 1.5, with extensions which offer enhanced security when both
sides of a connection are running FreSSH.&quot;
<p>

</ul>
