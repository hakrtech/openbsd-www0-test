<h2><font color=#e00000>Unix Alternatives</font><hr></h2>

If you choose not to use OpenSSH on Unix, the following "free" clients are
available for interporating with OpenSSH:<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.pdc.kth.se/pub/krypto/ossh/">OSSH</a>
is an SSH1-only implementation. BSD Licence.
<p>

Bj&ouml;rn Gr&ouml;nvall was the original person to remind our
community that very old versions of the real ssh had a free licence.
This is his own implementation.
OpenSSH was based on an early version of OSSH, but OpenSSH added
SSH2 and extended the SSH1 protocol support.
<p>

<li><a href="http://www.net.lut.ac.uk/psst/">LSH/psst</a>
is an SSH2-only implementation, by Niels M&ouml;ller in Sweden,
GPL Licence.
<p>

"ssh uses cryptographic techniques to enhance the security of everyday
distributed computing tasks such as file transfers, remote logins and
remote command execution. It's intended as a (more) secure alternative
to the likes of telnet, ftp, rsh, rlogin and rexec - and one which
requires much less effort to set up than Kerberos or IPSEC currently
do."
<p>

</ul>
