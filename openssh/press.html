</strong></font><br>

The latest release of SSH.COM's SSH1 offering gets a tepid welcome.
<i>"If you haven't already moved over to using OpenSSH, available under a
fully free license, this is a good time consider it"</i>. There is further
commentary in this <a href="http://lwn.net/2000/0706/security.php3">article

Kurt Seifried takes Linux vendors to task for -- among other sins -- shipping
telnet enabled by default, and no SSH.

Henry Kingman gives basic inetd security pointers and says you should replace
Telnet, and FTP with more modern tools like ssh and scp. Because of the
&quot;weird&quot; licence on SSH, commercial users should look at OpenSSH or
lsh, he writes.

"If you're still administering *NIX servers over the Internet using rsh
or telnet, stop right now," says author Lisa Phifer in the lead sentence
of her article. She then proceeds to show that it's not a big deal to
set up an OpenSSH 2.1 (SSH2) server and tests compatibility with three
commercial Windows clients. She also looks at simple VPN configurations.

This take-no-prisoners online zine credits the "Knights of OpenSSH" for the
ability to connect to servers from insecure cyber-cafe terminals. The wire
is secure, but what about those pesky keystroke loggers? No problem,
they say, just use S/KEY one-time passwords with ssh.

OpenSSH now supports the SSH 2 protocol.  Kudos to them for remembering the
history of SSH 2 correctly...<p>

</strong></font><br>

Linux columnist Evan Leibovitch discusses the possible ramifications
for open source software of the recently relaxed US government rules
governing crypto exports. However even if Linux distributions were able
to freely export strong cryptography, he notes the RSA patent still
makes it difficult to use OpenSSH and the OpenSSL library in the USA.
