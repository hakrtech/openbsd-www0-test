from Windows machines:<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>

extension DLL for Teraterm Pro. Teraterm Pro is a superb free terminal
emulator/telnet client for Windows, and its source is available. TTSSH
adds SSH capabilities to Teraterm Pro without sacrificing any of
Teraterm's existing functionality. TTSSH is also free to download and
use and its source is available too, with an open source
license. Furthermore, TTSSH has been developed entirely in Australia [...]."

Mac OS X includes OpenSSH by default. The following clients are
recommended for interoperating with OpenSSH from Mac OS machines:<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~jonasw/freeware/niftyssh/">NiftyTelnet 1.1 SSH</a>
is an SSH1-only implementation which comes with a
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=scp">scp</a>-style
program.  Written by Jonas Wallden.<p>

"NiftyTelnet 1.1 SSH r3 is an enhanced version of Chris Newman's
NiftyTelnet 1.1 application which adds support for encrypted terminal
sessions using the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol. Please read the
included Readme file before distributing this version."
<p>

<li><a href="http://www.macssh.com/">MacSSH</a> is an SSH2-only implementation.
<p>

"MacSSH is a modified version of BetterTelnet with SSH2 support. [...]
The only SSH2 client for Mac OS that I could find is a commercial product
thats costs more than $100, and it crashes my Mac when closing a session...
Since it's best to do things by oneself, here's MacSSH."
<p>

<li><a href="http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/">Fugu</a> is an implementation of SFTP and SCP.
<p>

"Fugu SSH is a Mac OS X graphical frontend to OpenSSH's Secure File

also includes support for SCP files transfers, and the ability to create 
secure tunnels through SSH."
<p>

<li><a href="http://cyberduck.ch/">Cyberduck</a> is an SFTP and FTP
browser.

browser licenced under the GPL. It has been built from the ground up
with usability in mind, having the same consistent graphical user
interface for both SFTP and FTP browsing. Multiple connections are
supported. [...] Core system technologies such as the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/security/">Keychain</a>
