<h2><font color=#e00000>Windows & Mac</font><hr></h2>

The following "free" clients are recommended for interoperating with OpenSSH
from Windows machines:<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>
is an SSH1+SSH2 implementation.  PSCP, an
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=scp">scp</a>-style
program for Windows, is also available.<br>
PuTTY is available under the MIT licence (BSD-like).
Putty's SSH2 mode
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist.html#dsa">
does not contain support for user authentication with DSA keys.</a>
<p>

"PuTTY is a free implementation of Telnet and SSH for Win32 platforms,
written and maintained primarily by Simon Tatham, who lives Great Britain."
<p>

<li><a href="http://www.zip.com.au/~roca/ttssh.html">TTSSH (SSH1)</a>
is an SSH1-only implementation, by Robert O'Callahan.
<p>

"TTSSH is a free SSH client for Windows. It is implemented as an
extension DLL for Teraterm Pro. Teraterm Pro is a superb free terminal
emulator/telnet client for Windows, and its source is available. TTSSH
adds SSH capabilities to Teraterm Pro without sacrificing any of
Teraterm's existing functionality. TTSSH is also free to download and
use and its source is available too, with an open source
license. Furthermore, TTSSH has been developed entirely in Australia [...]."
<p>

<li><a href="http://telneat.lipetsk.ru/">Telneat (SSH1)</a>
is a telnet/SSH client for Windows created by Kosta Schegloff
<p>

<ul>
<li>full telnet support

</ul>
<p>

<li><a href="http://cygwin">Cygwin (POSIX software on top of Windows)</a>
<p>
OpenSSH (SSH1 and SSH2 protocol) with Cygwin can run on Windows using the
<a href="portable.html">portable version of OpenSSH</a>.
<p>

<li><a href="http://cs.mscd.edu/MSSH/index.html">MSSH</a>
<p>
MSSH from the Metropolitan State College of Denver supports Windows 95
and Windows 98, supporting SSH1 protocol.
<p>

</ul>

The following clients are recommended for interoperating with OpenSSH from
Mac machines:<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~jonasw/freeware/niftyssh/">NiftyTelnet 1.1 SSH</a>
is an SSH1-only implementation which comes with a
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=scp">scp</a>-style
program.  Written by Jonas Wallden.<p>

"NiftyTelnet 1.1 SSH r3 is an enhanced version of Chris Newman's
NiftyTelnet 1.1 application which adds support for encrypted terminal
sessions using the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol. Please read the
included Readme file before distributing this version."
<p>

<li><a href="http://www.macssh.com/">MacSSH</a> is an SSH2-only implementation.
<p>

"MacSSH is a modified version of BetterTelnet with SSH2 support. [...]
The only SSH2 client for MacOS that I could find is a commercial product
thats costs more than $100, and it crashes my Mac when closing a session...
Since it's best to do things by oneself, here's MacSSH."

</ul>
