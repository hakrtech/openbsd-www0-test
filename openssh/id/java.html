<hr>

The following "free" clients are recommended for interoperating with
OpenSSH from Java clients:<p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.isnetworks.com/ssh/">MindTerm 1</a>
is an SSH1-only implementation. GPL Licence.
<p>

"MindTerm is an entirely FREE(*) SSH protocol 1 client program
written in 100% pure Java (non-certified). It is distributed with
source code since we believe that security related software can't
otherwise be seriously trusted. MindTerm can be run as a stand-alone
program or as an applet in a webpage. It can be run with or without a
GUI (stand-alone). It has two notable features setting it apart from
some other clients, built in scp file transfer and a special
ftp-tunnel which works with "ordinary" ftpd's "behind" the sshd."<p>
NOTE: Mindterm 2 is not free.
<p>

<li><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fapp2/software/java-ssh/">Java-SSH</a>
is an SSH1-only implementation, by C&eacute;dric Gourio.
Comes under a confusing mix of non-commercial and GPL licences.
<p>

"This applet implements the Ssh Protocol 1.5. The Terminal Emulation is
almost VT100 compliant. It provides secure communications over
insecure networks. All communications are automatically and
transparently encrypted. Encryption is also used to protect integrity."
<p>

<li><a href="http://www.mud.de/se/jta/doc/plugins/SSH.html">SSH Plugin</a>
is an SSH1-only implementation, by Matthias L. Jugel and Marcus Mei&szlig;ner.
GPL Licence.<p>

"This implementation of SSH provides IDEA and RSA/PKCS#1 encryption and
was originally written in 1998 by C&eacute;dric Gourio. He used a part of the
old Java Telnet Applet to write his Java SSH client and so the code
was similar to our old applet."
<p>

<li><a href="http://www.sshtools.com/">SSH Toolkits for Java</a>.
LGPL/GPL Licence.<p>

"We are currently offering three LGPL/GPL based projects: J2SSH, a
SSH2 library, SSHTerm,  a terminal client application, and a Windows
SSH Server."
<p>

</ul>
