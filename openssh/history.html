<h2><font color=#e00000>Project History and Credits</strong><hr></h2>

OpenSSH
is a derivative of the original free ssh 1.2.12 release
from Tatu Yl&ouml;nen.
<p>

Rapidly after the 1.2.12 release, newer versions bore successively more
restrictive licenses.  Earlier restrictive licenses forbade people from
making a Windows or DOS version.  Later licenses restricted the use of
ssh in a commercial environment, instead requiring companies to buy an
expensive version from Datafellows.
<p>

Earlier this year Bj&ouml;rn Gr&ouml;nvall re-discovered this
particular release and started fixing bugs.
His version of ssh is called
<a href=ftp://ftp.pdc.kth.se/pub/krypto/ossh/>OSSH</a>.
<p>
OpenBSD project members became aware of Bj&ouml;rn's work less than two months
before the
<a href=http://www.openbsd.org/26.html>OpenBSD 2.6 release</a>.  We wanted to
include ssh in the 2.6 release, but we had to make sure that it was perfect.
Therefore, we decided to immediately fork from the OSSH release, and pursue
rapid development in the same way as the original OpenBSD security auditing
process had happened.  As a result of this, many ssh source code files are
already on RCS revision 1.34, some as high as 1.66.  Development has gone
very fast indeed.
<p>

<ul>
<li>Theo de Raadt (CANADA) started by removing non-portabilities which made
the code harder to read -- the goal being simpler source code, so that
security holes and other issues could be spotted easier.
<li>Niels Provos (GERMANY but living in USA) quickly removed the remaining
cryptographic and GPL'd components by doing road trips to Canada, so that
we could end up with a completely freely reusable source code base.
<li>Markus Friedl (GERMANY) jumped in and very quickly managed to replace
the SSH protocol code, protocol 1.3 in the 1.2.12 release, with protocol
1.5 code compatible with the modern ssh 1.2.27 series (this change was
needed to operate with a lot of SSH-compatible Windows clients which lack
support for protocol 1.3).
<li>Bob Beck (CANADA) helped with Makefile magic to ensure that we could
compile OpenSSL without patented algorithms -- this was needed so that we
could ship our CD with libssl and libcrypto shared libraries (and the user
replaces these over the Internet when installing their machine).
<li>Aaron Campbell (CANADA) improved numerous documentation flaws and a
few other code problems.
<li>Dug Song (USA) helped with some authenticaion issues in the KerberosIV
case (his changes were carefully checked to ensure they stayed away from
any cryptographic issues).
</ul>
<p>

Therefore, OpenSSH is based on these older versions of ssh, but with
more bugs removed and newer features re-added:
<p>

<ul>

<li>has all components of a restrictive nature (i.e. patents,
see <a href=http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssl&sektion=8>ssl</a>)
directly removed from the source code; any licensed or patented components
are chosen from external libraries
(e.g. <a href=http://www.openssl.org/>OpenSSL</a>).

<li>has been updated to support ssh protocol 1.5.

<li>contains added support for
<a href=http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=kerberos&sektion=8>KerberosIV</a>
authentication and ticket passing.

<li>supports one-time password authentication with
<a href=http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=skey&sektion=1>skey</a>

<li>And hundreds of other changes that people can spot in the new man pages, and
	in the source code changes.
</ul>
<p>

OpenSSH has been created by Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl,
Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt, and Dug Song.  We thank the many people who
have found bugs and reported them.
