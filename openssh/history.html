<h2><font color=#e00000>Project History and Credits</strong><hr></h2>

OpenSSH
is a derivative of the original free ssh 1.2.12 release
from Tatu Yl&ouml;nen.<p>

Rapidly after the 1.2.12 release, newer versions bore successively
more restrictive licenses.<p>

Earlier this year Bj&ouml;rn Gr&ouml;nvall re-discovered this
particular release and started fixing bugs.
His version of ssh is called
<a href=ftp://ftp.pdc.kth.se/pub/krypto/ossh/>OSSH</a>.
<p>
OpenBSD project members became aware of Bj&ouml;rn's work less than two months
before the
<a href=http://www.openbsd.org/26.html>OpenBSD 2.6 release</a>.  We wanted to
include ssh in the 2.6 release, but we had to make sure that it was perfect.
Therefore, we decided to immediately fork from the OSSH release, and pursue
rapid development in the same way as the original OpenBSD security auditing
process had happened.  Theo de Raadt started by removing non-portabilities
which made the code harder to read -- the goal being simpler source code,
so that security holes and other issues could be spotted easier.  Niels
Provos quickly removed the remaining cryptographic and GPL'd components,
so that we could end up with a completely freely reusable source code base.
Markus Friedl jumped in and very quickly managed to replace the SSH protocol
code, revision 1.3 in the 1.2.12 release, with revision 1.5 code compatible
with the modern ssh 1.2.27 series (this change was needed to operate with
a lot of SSH-compatible Windows clients).<p>

Therefore, OpenSSH is based on these older versions of ssh, but with
more bugs removed and newer features re-added:
<p>
<ul>

<li>
has all components of a restrictive nature (i.e. patents,
see <a href=http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssl&sektion=8>ssl</a>)
directly removed from the source code; any licensed or patented components
are chosen from external libraries
(e.g. <a href=http://www.openssl.org/>OpenSSL</a>).

<li>
has been updated to support ssh protocol 1.5.

<li>
contains added support for
<a href=http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=kerberos&sektion=8>kerberos</a>
authentication and ticket passing.

<li>
supports one-time password authentication with
<a href=http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=skey&sektion=1>skey</a>

<li>And hundreds of other changes that people can spot in the new man pages, and
	in the source code changes.
</ul>
<p>
OpenSSH has been created by Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl,
Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt, and Dug Song.  We thank the many people who
have found bugs and reported them.
