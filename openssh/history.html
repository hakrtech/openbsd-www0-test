<h2><font color=#e00000>Project History and Credits</font></strong><hr></h2>

OpenSSH
is a derivative of the original free ssh 1.2.12 release
from Tatu Yl&ouml;nen.
<p>

Rapidly after the 1.2.12 release, newer versions bore successively more
restrictive licenses.  Earlier restrictive licenses forbade people from
making a Windows or DOS version.  Later licenses restricted the use of
ssh in a commercial environment, instead requiring companies to buy an
expensive version from Datafellows.
<p>

Earlier this year Bj&ouml;rn Gr&ouml;nvall re-discovered this
particular release and started fixing bugs.
His version of ssh is called
<a href=ftp://ftp.pdc.kth.se/pub/krypto/ossh/>OSSH</a>
and had only support for protocol 1.3.
Word of mouth has it that OSSH has been integrated
into some commercial products in Sweden.
As of today, OSSH does not have protocol 2 support.
<p>
OpenBSD project members became aware of Bj&ouml;rn's work less than two months
before the
<a href=http://www.openbsd.org/26.html>OpenBSD 2.6 release</a>.  We wanted to
include ssh in the 2.6 release, but we had to make sure that it was perfect.
Therefore, we decided to immediately fork from the OSSH release, and pursue
rapid development in the same way as the original OpenBSD security auditing
process had happened.  As a result of this, many ssh source code files are
already on RCS revision 1.34, some as high as 1.66.  Development has gone
very fast indeed.
<p>

<ul>
<li>Theo de Raadt (CANADA) started by removing non-portabilities which made
the code harder to read -- the goal being simpler source code, so that
security holes and other issues could be spotted easier.
<li>Niels Provos (GERMANY but living in USA) quickly removed the remaining
cryptographic and GPL'd components by doing road trips to Canada, so that
we could end up with a completely freely reusable source code base.
<li>Markus Friedl (GERMANY) jumped in and very quickly managed to replace
the SSH protocol code, protocol 1.3 in the 1.2.12 release, with a protocol
1.5 implementaion compatible with the modern ssh 1.2.27 series (this change was
needed to operate with a lot of SSH-compatible Windows clients which lack
support for protocol 1.3). His implementation is now used in OSSH.
Later, he also added support for protocol 2.0 and SFTP.
<li>Bob Beck (CANADA) helped with Makefile magic to ensure that we could
compile OpenSSL without patented algorithms -- this was needed so that we
could ship our CD with libssl and libcrypto shared libraries (and the user
replaces these over the Internet when installing their machine).
<li>Aaron Campbell (CANADA) improved numerous documentation flaws and a
few other code problems.
<li>Dug Song (USA) helped with some authentication issues in the KerberosIV
case (his changes were carefully checked to ensure they stayed away from
any cryptographic issues).
</ul>
<p>

Therefore, OpenSSH is based on these older versions of ssh, but with
more bugs removed and newer features re-added:
<p>

<ul>

<li>has all components of a restrictive nature (i.e. patents,
see <a href=http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssl&sektion=8>ssl</a>)
directly removed from the source code; any licensed or patented components
are chosen from external libraries
(e.g. <a href=http://www.openssl.org/>OpenSSL</a>).

<li>has been updated to support ssh protocol 1.5.

<li>contains added support for
<a href=http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=kerberos&sektion=8>KerberosIV</a>
authentication and ticket passing.

<li>supports one-time password authentication with
<a href=http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=skey&sektion=1>skey</a>

<li>And hundreds of other changes that people can spot in the new man pages, and
	in the source code changes.
</ul>
<p>

That marked the OpenSSH 1.2.2 release, which shipped with OpenBSD 2.6 in
December 1, 1999.  As of that time, most OpenSSH development had been done
by Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt,
and Dug Song.  We thank the many people who have found bugs and reported them.
<p>

<h3>Porting OpenSSH</h3>
Almost immediately after we shipped our protocol 1 implementation,
various non-OpenBSD groups got very, very interested.  Damien Miller,
Philip Hands, and handful of others started porting OpenSSH to Linux
and various other Unix operating systems.  From the start of our own
efforts, we have felt that even the original ssh code was too
complicated, it simply had too many operating system dependencies to
deal with.  Our approach to writing completely secure and rock solid
code avoids dealing with excessive differences like that.  Thus, to
make the entire development process easier on us all, we decided to
split our core development efforts from portability developments.
This has worked out very well for us.  (As a case in point, compare the
number of lines of code between the baseline and portable versions).
<p>

<h3>Protocol 2</h3>
With the OpenBSD 2.6 release out of the way, Markus Friedl decided to
pursue <a href="goals.html">protocol 2</a> support.  Slaving away for
months, he managed to keep OpenSSH slim and lean, while at the same
time managing to turn it into a single piece of software that could do
both protocols 1 and 2.  This version, called OpenSSH 2.0, ships with
OpenBSD 2.7 on June 15, 2000.  Most of the checking of Markus' changes
were done by Niels Provos and Theo de Raadt.  Bob Beck is to be thanked
for updating OpenSSL to a newer version.
<p>

<h3>Scanning SSH Server Versions</h3>
To facilitate the monitoring of deployed SSH servers, e.g. for a
company network, Niels Provos wrote the
<a href="ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/scanssh/scanssh-1.2.tar.gz">scanssh</a>
tool.  scanssh scans a list of addresses and networks for running SSH
servers and their version numbers.  It supports random selection of IP
addresses from large network ranges and is useful for gathering
statistics on the use of SSH servers in a company or the Internet as
whole.  The statistics include the SSH protocol and software
versions that are being used.
<p>
scanssh is being used by the
<a href="http://ssh-research-scanner.ucs.ualberta.ca/">SSH Research Scanner</a>
at the University of Alberta to gather statistics about the deployment
and use of SSH on the Internet.  The measurements allow insights into
the distribution of the different SSH protocols and the market
penetration of particular server versions.
