<hr>

OpenSSH has no wealthy sponsors, nor a business model.
<p>
Naturally, the OpenSSH project requires funds to operate, due to
electrial costs, Internet line costs and the same hardware upgrades
that everyone must experience.  For this reason, the project sells
CDROMs and T-shirts and posters.  Thus, when you buy an OpenBSD CD,
whether at a conference, from any sales site, or from our
<a href="orders.html">CDROM ordering page</a>, you are helping to
increase the chance that OpenSSH will continue to make future releases.
<p>
It is also possible to donate funds or <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/want.html">hardware</a>,
in which case your name ends up on our 
<a href="donations.html">Donations page</a>.
<p>
<hr>
There are four main ways fund the project with financial donations:
<ul>
<li><font color="#e00000">Cheques</font><br>
Simply send a donation cheque in CDN/US/EUR funds made out to
Theo de Raadt (since cheques made out to "OpenSSH" cannot be cashed).
(Or mail <a href="mailto:deraadt@openbsd.org">Theo de Raadt</a> for other ideas).
<p>

<p>

<li><font color="#e00000">Credit Card</font><br>
Our online ordering system can do secure credit card transactions for
<a href="https://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/donations">
donations from major credit cards</a>.<br>
Or you can combine your donation with
<a href="https://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order">an order of our other items</a>.
<p>

<li><font color="#e00000">IBAN + BIC</font><br>
For International bank transfer, people can use
<a href="bank-donation.html">
IBAN or SWIFT/BIC direct bank transfers</a>.
<p>

<li><font color="#e00000">PayPal</font><br>
<a href="https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=paypal%40openssh.com&amp;item_name=OpenSSH+Donation&amp;no_shipping=2">We can also accept donations via PayPal</a>
</ul>

<hr>
<p>
While donations are not US tax deductible as charitable contribution,
they may be deductible as an operating expense, and if someone is so
inclined, they should ask for the advice of their accountant.  The
same applies to other countries, where corporations can make deductible
donations under the terms of "Good Will".
<p>
We have a <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/want.html">list of hardware</a> that we would like to
see donated to the project.  We would appreciate it if people would look
through the list and compare it to personal or corporate junk piles.
Amongst other reasons, the list exists so that project members can own
devices that should be supported, so that future releases ship with better
device driver support.
<p>
It is now possible to donate money to the project online via
<a href="https://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order">credit card</a> or
<a href="https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=paypal%40openssh.com&amp;item_name=OpenSSH+Donation&amp;no_shipping=1">PayPal</a>.

<p>

The following people and organizations (listed in chronological order) have
contributed money, equipment, or services to the OpenSSH project.

We would also like to thank everyone who has purchased an OpenBSD
CDROM.  These sales fund the project and keep it alive.  Buy one for a
friend if you can!

<p>

list, please send mail to www@openssh.org.  WARNING: www@openssh.org is a
