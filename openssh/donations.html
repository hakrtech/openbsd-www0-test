<h2><font color="#e00000">Donations</font></h2>
<hr>

OpenSSH has no wealthy sponsors, nor a business model.  In fact, no
Commercial Unix or Linux vendor has ever given our project a cent.
<p>
Naturally, the OpenSSH project requires funds to operate -- particularily
so that our team members can meet in person once in a while (at OpenBSD
hackathons) to design new ideas.
<p>
<hr>
There are three main ways fund the project with financial donations:
<ul>
<li><font color="#e00000">Cheques</font><br>
Simply send a donation cheque in CDN/US/EUR funds made out to
Theo de Raadt, since<br>
cheques made out to "OpenSSH" cannot be cashed.
(Or mail <a href="mailto:deraadt@openbsd.org">Theo de Raadt</a> for other ideas).
<p>
Theo de Raadt<br>
OpenSSH<br>
812 23rd Ave SE<br>
Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2G 1N8<p>
<p>

<li><font color="#e00000">Credit Card</font><br>
The OpenBSD online ordering system can do secure credit card transactions for
<a href="https://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/donations">
donations from major credit cards</a>.<br>
Or you can combine your donation with
<a href="https://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order">
an order for some OpenSSH tshirts or posters</a>.<br>
If you are donating specifically for OpenSSH, please mark the entry so.
<p>

<li><font color="#e00000">IBAN + BIC</font><br>
For International bank transfer, people can use
<a href="bank-donation.html">
IBAN or SWIFT/BIC direct bank transfers</a>.
<p>

</ul>

<hr>
<p>
While donations are not US tax deductible as charitable contribution,
they may be deductible as an operating expense, and if someone is so
inclined, they should ask for the advice of their accountant.  The
same applies to other countries, where corporations can make deductible
donations under the terms of "Good Will".
<p>
We specifically are not a non-profit organization, as that would limit
the nationalities that we could spend such money in.
<p>
We include all people who donate to OpenSSH in our
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/donations.html#people">OpenBSD donation list</a>.
