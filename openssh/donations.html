<h2><font color="#e00000">Donations</font></h2>
<hr>

OpenSSH has no wealthy sponsors, nor a business model.  In fact, no
Commercial Unix or Linux vendor has ever given our project a cent.
Naturally, the OpenSSH project requires funds to operate -- particularly
so that our team members can meet in person once in a while (at OpenBSD
hackathons) to design new ideas.
<p>
Donations are handled via OpenBSD, since OpenBSD is the environment
and community where OpenSSH is developed.
<p>
<hr>
There are five main ways to fund the project with financial donations:
<ul>
<li><font color="#e00000">Cheques</font><br>
Simply send a donation cheque in CAD/EUR/USD funds made out to
Theo de Raadt, since<br>
cheques made out to "OpenSSH" cannot be cashed.
(Or mail <a href="mailto:deraadt@openbsd.org">Theo de Raadt</a> for other ideas).
<p>
Theo de Raadt<br>
812 23rd Ave SE<br>
Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2G 1N8<p>
<p>

<li><font color="#e00000">Credit Card</font><br>
Our online ordering system can do secure credit card transactions for
<a href="https://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/donations">
donations from major credit cards</a>.<br>
Or you can combine your donation with
<a href="https://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order">an order of our other items</a>.
<p>

<li><font color="#e00000">IBAN + BIC</font><br>
For International bank transfer, people can use
<a href="bank-donation.html">
IBAN or SWIFT/BIC direct bank transfers</a>.
<p>

<li><font color="#e00000">PayPal</font><br>
PayPal donations may now be made to support OpenBSD. Donations
can be made one at a time, or by monthly subscription payable in
CAD/EUR/USD at
<a href="http://www.openbsdfoundation.org/donations.html">The OpenBSD
Foundation</a>.
<p>

<li><font color="#e00000">The OpenBSD Foundation</font><br>
For those unable to make their contributions as straightforward gifts, the
<a href="http://www.openbsdfoundation.org">OpenBSD Foundation</a>
is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-profit_organization#Canada">
Canadian not-for-profit corporation</a> that can accept larger contributions
and issue receipts.  In some situations, their receipt may qualify
as a business expense writeoff, so this is certainly a consideration for
some organizations or businesses.  There may also be exposure benefits
since the Foundation may be interested in participating in press releases.
<p>
In turn, the Foundation then uses these contributions to assist OpenBSD's
infrastructure needs, and thus directly helps OpenSSH.  Contact the
foundation directors at
<a href="mailto:directors@openbsdfoundation.org">directors@openbsdfoundation.org</a>
for more information.
</ul>

<hr>
<p>
While donations (as gifts) are not generally tax deductible as charitable
contribution, they may be deductible as an operating expense (or check the
<a href="http://www.openbsdfoundation.org">OpenBSD Foundation</a> above
for an even better way), and if someone is so inclined, they should ask for
the advice of their accountant.  In some countries corporations can make
deductible donations under the terms of "Good Will".  Those who need very
strict contribution receipts could consider contributing to
<a href="http://www.openbsdfoundation.org">OpenBSD Foundation</a> instead.
<p>
The people and organizations who have contributed money, equipment, or
services to OpenSSH are not kept separate, but are combined with the
list of people who have donated to all OpenBSD projects.  That list can
be found at the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/donations.html#people">
main OpenBSD donation page</a>.
<p>

Emails about the contents of the donations list: <p> 

Since there are several methods of contributing to the OpenBSD project there
are different maintainers of postings to the list for each method.  For
funds or equipment sent directly to one of the developers then that person
will update the list and you are presumably in contact already.  Email
addresses for other maintainers at openbsd.org are as follows:<br> 

<ul>
<li>Via all web order forms: Austin Hook - austin@ 
<li>Donations via PayPal: <a href="http://www.openbsdfoundation.org/">The
OpenBSD Foundation</a>.
<li>Donations via Euro bank transfer: Theo de Raadt - deraadt@ 
</ul><p>

Note that email sent to www@ (mentioned below) will appear on a public forum.
