<P>We are now associated with <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com"> Amazon.com</A>
so that you can order some of these books directly from them.
<EM>Ordering from these "Order from Amazon" links is a way of helping to

<H2>User Guides</H2>
<P>"Berkeley UNIX" (now known as "BSD", for Berkeley Software Distribution)
is so widely known that there is no need to list
the basic "how-to" books about it here - there are too many to list!
Some of the user guides cover exclusively the System V version, or
some specific implementation such as Solaris, Linux, or whatever,
while others try to be general. There are some that cover Berkeley UNIX.
<P><FONT COLOR="Red">UNIX Made Easy</FONT> is one general book that
is said to be good, though we've not tested it.

<P>Two BSD-specific UNIX user's guides still in print are:

<P>Every advanced UNIX user will probably want a copy of
<FONT COLOR=Red>UNIX Power Tools</FONT>, now in its second edition.

<P>You may see reference to the <FONT COLOR=Red>4.4 BSD 
User's Reference Manual (URM)</FONT>, O'Reilly, 1994
<P>This is just a reprint of the man pages for users. 
Your OpenBSD distribution includes the online man pages,
which are specific to OpenBSD, and more up-to-date. So
you don't need this one: use the <EM>man</EM> command instead.

<H2>Administering the OpenBSD System</H2>
We can't unreservedly recommend any books specifically on OpenBSD 
Administration at present. However, if you're administering OpenBSD
you may also have to administer other versions of UNIX. A good
book on UNIX administration, with special mentions of details in
SunOS, Solaris, and BSDI, the commercial 4.4BSD distribution, is
<FONT Color=Red>UNIX System Administration Handbook</FONT>, Second Edition, by Evi Nemeth,
Garth Snyder, et al.
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0131510517/openbsdA/">Order from Amazon</A>.

<P><FONT COLOR=Red>4.4 BSD System Manager's Manual (SMM)</FONT>
O'Reilly, 1994
<P>Details on what you need to run a BSD system.
Quite a bit of this material is relevant to OpenBSD.
Unfortunately it is currently out of print.
Worse, Due to licensing restrictions from AT&T,
the electronic editions of these were not included in the 
4.4BSD distributions, so most of them are not included with OpenBSD.
The few that are can be found via the <A HREF="docum.html">Documents page</A>.

<P><EM>Avoid</EM> books on installing/configuration particular "other"
distributions of BSD, as the installation procedures for each are
wildly different.

<H2>Books on Programming Under the BSD System</H2>

<P><FONT COLOR=Red>4.4 BSD Programmer's Reference Manual (PRM)</FONT>
O'Reilly, 1994
<P>This is a printed version of the Programmer's Manual.
You have the online man pages, which are specific to OpenBSD, instead.
Use the <EM>man</EM> command to read these!

<P><FONT COLOR=Red>BSD-Lite 4.4 CD-ROM Companion: International Edition</FONT>
UC Berkeley Staff, Computer Systems Research Group; O'Reilly, 1994
This neat little package contains a CD-ROM with just the unbundled
portions of 4.4BSD-Lite-1, which not only is obsolete, but is not a
complete, bootable system. Also a small booklet listing contributors,
and the index to the printed man pages. Overall, not very useful.
<A HREF="orders.html">Buy an OpenBSD CD-ROM instead!</A>

<P>An older book which still sheds much light on the philosophy
of programmi UNIX is <FONT COLOR=Red>The UNIX Programming Environment</FONT>,
by Kernighan and Pike. It is not specific to BSD, but most of it applies.

<H2>Books about how the System works, for those wanting to modifying it</H2>
<P><A HREF="http://cseng.aw.com/bookdetail.qry?ISBN=0-201-54979-4&ptype=0">The Design and Implementation of the 4.4 BSD Operating System</A>
Marshal Kirk McKusick, Keith Bostic, Michael J. Karels, John S. Quarterman
Addison-Wesley: 1996. ISBN 0-201-54979-4.

<P>At 549 pages plus index. this must be considered comprehensive.
McKusick, Bostic and Karels are well known as prime movers at
Berkeley CSRG (Computer Systems Research Group) during the 4.3/4.4BSD
period. This book covers the 4.4 and 4.4-Lite releases, and discusses
everything you wanted to know about how the system operates.  Not
100% applicable, but probably the closest there is to an overall
system internals manual for OpenBSD.

<P><FONT COLOR=Red>The Design and Implementation of the 4.3 BSD Unix Operating System</FONT>
Samuel J. Leffler, Marshall Kirk McKusick
<P>An earlier book from many of the same good folk at CSRG.
Slightly dated, but gives an overall feel for the beast if you can find
it real cheap at a garage sale.

<P><FONT COLOR=Red>The Design and Implementation of the 4.3 BSD Unix Operating System : Answer Book</FONT>
Samuel J. Leffler, Marshall Kirk McKusick
1991
<P>Answers to the "exercises for the reader" in the 4.3 version of the book.

<P><FONT COLOR=Red>Source Code Secrets: The Basic 386BSD 
Operating System Reference</FONT>
(Volume 1 of Operating System Source Code Secrets)
L. W. Jolitz, William Jolitz
1997
<P>The Jolitzes built the first port of BSD to the PC-386 architecture,
and deserve a lot of credit for making BSD portable to this low-cost
architecture. The earliest versions, called "386bsd", were described
in articles in <EM>Dr. Dobbs Journal</EM>. This book goes beyond the articles,
and provides a comprehensive annotated collection of source code.
Not all of it applies to modern versions of OpenBSD, of course, but
you can still learn a lot from it.

<P><FONT COLOR=Red>Lions' Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition with Source Code</FONT>,
Peer-to-Peer ommunications, 1996.  ISBN 1-57398-013-7.
Although the UNIX described in this book is to BSD as a Model T Ford
is to a 70's Mustang or Thunderbird, UNIX inventor Ken Thompson
claims that "After 20 years, this is still the best exposition
of the workings of a 'real' operating system." Originally circulated
in illicit photocopies, this is the book that most first- and second-generation
UNIX hackers cut their code-teeth on. Recommended as a good introduction
to how a timesharing OS works, if you've not been inside one before.
Substantially shorter than the McKusick book above.
