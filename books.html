<i>The Design and Implementation of the 4.4 BSD Operating System</i>
<dd>by Marshal Kirk McKusick, Keith Bostic, Michael J. Karels, John S. Quarterman
<dd>
At 549 pages plus an index, <A HREF="http://cseng.aw.com/bookdetail.qry?ISBN=0-201-54979-4&ptype=0">this book</a> must be considered comprehensive.
McKusick, Bostic and Karels are well known as prime movers at
Berkeley CSRG (Computer Systems Research Group) during the 4.3/4.4BSD
period. This book covers the 4.4 and 4.4-Lite releases, and discusses
everything you wanted to know about how the system operates.  Not
100% applicable, but probably the closest there is to an overall
system internals manual for OpenBSD.

<i>Source Code Secrets: The Basic 386BSD Operating System Reference
(Volume 1 of Operating System Source Code Secrets)</i>
<dd>by L. W. Jolitz, William Jolitz; 1997
<dd>
The Jolitzes built the first port of BSD to the PC-386 architecture,
and deserve a lot of credit for making BSD portable to this low-cost
architecture. The earliest versions, called "386bsd", were described
in articles in <EM>Dr. Dobbs Journal</EM>. This book goes beyond the articles,
and provides a comprehensive annotated collection of source code.
Not all of it applies to modern versions of OpenBSD, of course, but
you can still learn a lot from it.

<i>An Introduction to Berkeley Unix and ANSI C</i>
<dd>by Jack Hodges
<dd>
An introduction to the operating system and the programming language.  Intended
for self-study, requires no previous knowledge of Unix.  Covers the fundamentals
of programming; the correct use of syntax; programming style, debugging, logic,
and system programming with C.

<i>4.4 BSD User's Reference Manual (URM)</i>
<dd>published by O'Reilly, 1994
<dd>
This is just a reprint of the man pages for users. 
Your OpenBSD distribution includes the online man pages,
which are specific to OpenBSD, and more up-to-date. So
you don't need this one: use the <em>man</em> command instead.

<i>4.4 BSD System Manager's Manual (SMM)</i>
<dd>published by O'Reilly, 1994
<dd>
This book details what you need to know to run a BSD system.
Quite a bit of this material is relevant to OpenBSD.
Unfortunately it is currently out of print.
Worse, due to licensing restrictions from AT&amp;T,
the electronic editions of these were not included in the
4.4BSD distributions, so most of them are not included with OpenBSD.
The few that are may be found via the <a href="docum.html">Documents page</a>.

<dt><i>Unix Made Easy</i>
<dd>by John Muster
<dd>A general Unix book that covers all areas of the system.

<p>
<dt><i>UNIX Power Tools</i>
<dd>by Jerry D. Peek, Tim O'Reilly, and Mike Loukides
<dd>
This book is now now in its second edition. It discusses
hundreds of neat tricks, little-known techniques, and add-on utilities.
Be aware that many of the utilities are either included with OpenBSD
or, more commonly, are already available as ports or packages.
So most of section 52.03, complaining about how hard it is to port
software to different UNIXes, can be disregarded if you learn about the
<a href="ports.html">Ports Mechanism</a>
that is part of OpenBSD.

<dt><i>Unix Systems for Modern Architectures</i>
<dd>by Curt Schimmel
<dd>
This book leads its' reader through all the low-level kernel models for 
multi-processing architectures.  OpenBSD does not implement multi-processing
capabilities as of yet, but what do you think the developers are reading?

<dt><i>Lions' Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition with Source Code</i>
<dd>by John Lions
<dd>
Although the UNIX described in this book is to BSD as a Model T Ford
is to a 70's Mustang or Thunderbird, UNIX inventor Ken Thompson
claims that "After 20 years, this is still the best exposition
of the workings of a 'real' operating system." Originally circulated
in illicit photocopies, this is the book that most first- and second-generation
UNIX hackers cut their code-teeth on. Recommended as a good introduction
to how a timesharing OS works, if you've not been inside one before.
Substantially shorter than the McKusick book above.

<dt><i>The Practice of Programming</i>
<dd>by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike
<dd>
Brian Kernighan had a hand in two other books which we recommend even though they're not UNIX specific, but are useful to programmers on UNIX and elsewhere.
This book covers practical programming considerations for C, C++ and Java. 
Highly recommended.

<dt><i>The Elements of Programming Style</i>
<dd>by Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger
<dd>
This book is similar to <i>The Practice of Programming</i>, but older.  The
examples are given in Fortran and PL/I.

<dt><i>Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment</i>
<dd>by W. Richard Stevens
<dd>
This is a very detailed and easy to read book.  It has several examples
that you can learn from.  There is plenty of information about library and
system calls, and associated information so that you can use them.
This book along with the OpenBSD manual pages
make an excellent combination.

<h3><a name="6">Network administration</a></h3>
<dl>
<dt><i>TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1</i>
<dd>by W. Richard Stevens
<dd>
"Network administration" is really an inappropriate heading for this book.  It
is an encyclopedia of the TCP/IP protocol suite.  This book provides information,
and diagrams useful to understand the suite to its' lowest level.
Home enthusiasts, developers, and network administrators alike will enjoy this
book.
