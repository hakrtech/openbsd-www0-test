<h2><font color=#e00000>OpenBSD: Users' View</font><hr></h2>
<p>Many users have commented on their use of OpenBSD.
The following are all extracts from our public mailing lists or,
occasionally, other mailing lists (these have links to the original articles).
Postings have been shortened, and edited slightly for spelling and grammar,
but are otherwise unchanged.

<h2>Matthew Haas says this:</h2>
<p>
I've been very impressed with OpenBSD since my decision to install it.
Definitely a great system, reminds me of my Slackware days, but better.
<p>
Thanks.

By way of success stories, since a few of us at 2600 Australia started
using OpenBSD about 12 months ago now in some form or another, we've seen...
friends load it onto their machines and been simply amazed
at the quality of it, in particular the forethought that goes into
securing things out of the box.
<p>
We've also had one of our guys working at an ISP go head-to-head with an
in-house SuSE zealot of sorts on a compatibility, stability and security
test in advance of them selecting an operating system for their servers
(which, while using RedHat, had been rooted at least once).  OpenBSD passed
with flying colors and as of today, they're beginning a roll-out of 2.6
onto their servers, mostly using stock components and software from the
ports tree (qmail, cucipop etc).

<h2>System and Network Administrator Jeff Schneiter offers this:</h2>
<p> With a frozen budget it sure makes one squeeze every last
bit of power out of whatever hardware one can lay his hands
on... and thanks to OpenBSD, I have been doing just that.

<h2><a name=sarendal href="mailto:tony@polarcap.org">Tony Sarendal</a> says this:</h2>
<p>I tried OpenBSD because of the IPsec support.
The reason I stick with it is because it really is nice to use
and it gives a feeling of quality which no other OS can match.
<p>
I did some programming on an OpenBSD machine, after this I really
appreciated the man pages. Other Unices I used had man pages that
simply weren't any good. 
<p>
Keep up the good work guys.

<h2>Security Engineer Tyler Allison writes:</h2>
<p>
I have installed, secured, and maintained Linux, Windows NT and OpenBSD in
highly secure environments. (yes you can secure Linux and Windows NT in
this environment :)  ).  Having said that I have to point out that if you
want a minimum administration to keep up with security issues option you 
need to pick OpenBSD by far.  It is not uncommon for people to go years without 
updating their production OpenBSD machines because they are just rock solid
and there are no known "remote" vulnerabilities.  Thus no good reason to
upgrade...
<p>
I would feel perfectly happy to have one of my [novice] interns do a basic 
OpenBSD install on a PC (no extra security work after the install) and then put
the companies crown jewels on that machine and then walk away for a year.
Knowing full well that machine hasn't crashed, been broken into or in need 
of an OS upgrade.  You can't say that about NT or Linux. 
Or if you do you obviously havent ever used the product that way :)
<p>
Another thing that I hear people point out is go check your local exploit
site or vulnerability alert mailing list and see if you can find a "remote"
root level exploit that works on OpenBSD. I dare say you won't find any that 
are less than 12 months old.

<h2>Jan Johansson gave this reply to a "how do I build a cheap web server?" query:</h2>
<p>
I work today with Solaris, OpenBSD, NT Server, NT Workstation and Win 95.
<p>
After reading Bugtraq for some weeks I will say that I will never put 
any (important) machine on the Internet if there is not a firewall in 
front and for packet filtering I go for OpenBSD...
<p>
For a cheap web server I say hardware from a known vendor, an ordered 
OpenBSD CD-ROM and Apache...

<p>[A few] years ago I was just getting into system administration.  I learned
Linux first.  Then one of our old (I mean *really* old) BSDi servers
crashed, and it was up to me to rebuild the system.
<p>
I looked at FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Linux.  In the end, it came down
to "secure and stable" that took the prize.  OpenBSD 2.1 was installed.
<p>
Since then, I've run 2.1-2.5 on everything from production servers to
laptops.  We've never (repeat: NEVER) had a break-in.
<p>
A coworker setup a RedHat based box to test his skills at setting up SSL
and a secure web site.
It was hacked literally overnight, and by the next morning was attacking
other sites.
<p>
Our OpenBSD servers were probed and then left alone.
<p>
In the intervening two years, that original server got upgraded 
and patched several
times and the OS never gave us reason to question the reliability or
security of OpenBSD.
<p>
We have another box, acting as a router for about 800 workstations doing
very basic filtering and NAT.  It's on a P120 with 32MB RAM and typically
the uptime would look like this:
<pre>
% uptime
 9:05PM  up 266 days,  4:23, 1 user, load averages: 0.06, 0.06, 0.06
%</pre>
<p>As well, OpenBSD runs on my laptop.
A Gateway Solo 2500 with a Xircom modem, and a Linksys fast Ethernet NIC.
<p>
And it never crashes :)
<p>
One other incident that made me a believer... we were pingbombed
[perhaps a predecessor to the early2000 DDOS attacks?].  I mean,
900 different hosts on different networks floodpinging an OpenBSD 2.3 box
simultaneously, while it was processing email and web pages for 3500 users.
<p>
It was a P133 with 64MB ram.  And it didn't go down.  It got a bit slower,
but never crashed :-)

<h2>John J. Adelsberger III said this about us in Bruce Schneier's 
<a href="http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-0004.html#CommentsfromReaders">
Crypto-Gram</a>:</h2>
(the comments he is responding to are Schneier's)
<br>
<br>&gt; Real systems show no signs of becoming less 
<br>&gt; complex. In fact, they are becoming more complex,
<br>&gt; faster and faster. Microsoft Windows is a poster 
<br>&gt; child for this trend to complexity.
<br>
<br>...
<br>
<br>&gt; The other choice is to slow down, to simplify, 
<br>&gt; and to try to add security.
<p>
OpenBSD does this. <I>I am unaware of any other group whose workings
are publicly viewable that does so</I> [emphasis added], which is regrettable, because
I would prefer not to have this appear as an OpenBSD plug; rather,
my purpose is to point out that not only is this approach feasible,
but it is being done.

<h2>Andrew Hermetz commented as follows:</h2>
<p>Hey all,
<p>Just wanted to drop a line and thank all who have worked to make OpenBSD
such a clean, cool, &amp; efficient project.
<p>Major kudos to Theo for being a man ahead of his time! ;-)
<p>As I have to frequently explain to people *why* security is important at
all ("if you have nothing to hide...", "nothing you do is important enough to
warrant encryption...", "only criminals and terrorists need to sneak around
anonymously...", etc. ad nauseam), let alone *why* it's important in this day
and age of personal networks behind a DSL or even a full T1, I love being able
to point them to a page which sets out a well-reasoned explanation for taking
computer security seriously.
<p>[... OpenBSD installed]
effortlessly onto a Pentium 90 Compaq LTE 5100 laptop -- even the no-name
brand LAN card came right up and did a kickass install over a friend's office
T1. When I sing its praises, the thing that seems to get most people is its
spartan look & feel, but I like knowing where everything is and not having a
distro that shoves [stuff] into dark corners I'll never find...
