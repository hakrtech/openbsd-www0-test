<h2>OpenBSD/arc</h2>

<hr>
<h3><strong>History and Status:</strong></h3>

<p>
The early history is not very clear. Apparently the first work was
done by CMU as part of their Mach project.  The initial hardware was
the DEC R2000/R3000-based DECstations.  This code was later used by
both the Sprite and BSD groups.  The 4.4BSD code, known as the `pmax'
port, was made freely available in mid '93.  It was merged into the
NetBSD tree by a variety of people, but has never been very stable,
reliable, or complete.  Compiler toolkit problems have plagued the
port because the standard a.out executable format is an imperfect
match to the MIPS architecture.
</p>

<p>
Per Fogelstr&ouml;m became familiar with the code after porting it to a
home-built IDT R3081 based board.  Subsequently he added R4400 support
when porting it to the MIPS R4400 Acer PICA board.  Willowglen
Singapore purchased a second PICA board for Theo de Raadt so that he
could improve the port for use as a development system for an internal
project.  Since then Theo, Per and others have completed the port.
</p>

<p>
The Acer PICA is a dead platform.  Acer no longer makes the machine,
but even worse the machines are very rare.  But the Acer PICA was just
one of a whole family of similar machines built by other companies
like MIPS, Deskstation, NEC, Olivetti.  These machines were known as
ARC machines, built according to the 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/download/respec/riscspec.zip">
Advanced RISC Computing</a> specification.
No new ARC BIOS machines for MIPS will likely be manufactured.
Microsoft has announced that it will no longer support MIPS after NT 4.0.
OpenBSD/arc provides a good alternative to NT, especially now that no more OS
updates for NT MIPS will happen.  Deskstation has ceased business operations,
so there will be no more ARC MIPS machines from them.
</p>

<p>
As a result, the code has been modified to make it more versatile, and
eventually it should support a larger whole range of ARC machines.
Hopefully a port will result that can run on the full range of MIPS
processors: R4000, R4xx, R43xx, R4400, R46x0, R4700, R5000, 
R8000 and R10000.

	and serial.
<li><a href="http://www.deskstation.com">Deskstation</a>
	Tyne: 133MHz R4600, ISA and VLB.
<li><a href="http://www.deskstation.com">Deskstation</a>
	rPC44: 100MHz R4400PC, EISA bus.
<li><a href=http://www.algor.co.uk>Algorithmics</a> R4000/R5000/R10000 evaluation board
<li>NEC RiscStation works.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Supported devices include:</h3>

  <li> ISA tty00 and tty01 on systems without serial ports on the motherboard (Tyne).
  <li> ISA tty02 and tty03 on all ISA capable systems.
  </ul>

  </ul>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<h3>The following ports are also being worked on:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Algorithmics P-4032 and P-5064 boards.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The people working the most on OpenBSD/arc currently consists of
Per Fogelstr&ouml;m, Theo de Raadt, Niklas Hallqvist, Warner Losh,
and a few others. Of course, others are very welcome!
</p>

<p>
<h3>Recent developments:</h3>
<ul>
<li>PCI bus support on Algorithmics P-4032 and P-5064 boards.
<li>Support for <a href=http://www.qedinc.com>QED</a> RM52x0 processors. (R5000 derivates).
<li>Kernel DDB functional.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The ARC port is complete, including everything you can expect
on any OpenBSD port.
