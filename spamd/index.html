OpenBSD's
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=spamd&amp;sektion=8">spamd(8)</a>
is a SPAM deferral daemon which rejects false mail in a very efficient way.
<br>
A variety of databases exist here which can be specified in the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=spamd.conf&amp;sektion=5">/etc/spamd.conf</a>
file, and loaded using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=spamd-setup&amp;sektion=8">spamd-setup(8)</a>.
<p>

Some of the URLs below point to www.openbsd.org locations.  That means
that some of the OpenBSD www mirrors located around the world will
also contain these files.  Hence, it is possible to edit
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=spamd.conf&amp;sektion=5">
/etc/spamd.conf</a>
and replace www.openbsd.org with, for instance, www.de.OpenBSD.org.
The actual www.openbsd.org links are local links; meaning, those files
may be accessable from this mirror directly; for instance, if you were
using www.de.OpenBSD.org

<li><a href="http://www.spews.org">Spews Level 1</a><br>
<font color="#a00000">"SPEWS publishes two lists. The majority of the Level 1 list
is made up of netblocks owned by the spammers or spam support
operations themselves, with few or no other legitimate customers
detected. We don't even try and educate these types as any past
attempts at education have failed. If a known spammer buys a
new netblock but hasn't started spamming from it yet, it is still
eligible to be listed here. If used, this list should have close to
zero inadvertent blocking."</font> (from their web page)

<font color="#a00000">
"This includes all of Level 1, plus anyone who is
spam-friendly, supporting spammers, or highly suspicious, but not
blatant enough to be included in the Level 1 list yet. If it becomes
obvious that someone at Level 2 has become a real problem, they
will be escalated to Level 1 after some attempt at education. The
Level 2 list will have some inadvertent blocking (non-spammer IP
addresses listed), but can still be used by small ISPs or
individuals who want a stricter level of blocking/filtering. By
having a two tiered list, you can make the hardcore spamfighters
happy; those who want to block first and ask questions later.
Also, a listing in the Level 2 list may exert a bit of pressure on
spam friendly sites and may keep them from turning totally bad -
but that is not really the point, stopping spam is. (note: a Level
value of "0" means that area is not listed)"</font> (from their web page)

<font color="#a00000">
"Because these two countries have the chronic and pervasive practice
of a) providing a safe haven for their own spammers; b) providing a
safe haven for U.S. spammers; c) hosting mail servers which are open
relays or proxies; d) being either too ignorant and/or lazy to secure
those servers; and most importantly, e) almost never responding to or
addressing abuse complaints (in the rare event their abuse reporting
addresses even work); I decided to block all email from China and
Korea altogether. So, in April 2002, I started compiling lists of all
net blocks assigned to Korea and China to be used to that end."</font>
