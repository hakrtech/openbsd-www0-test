<h2>OpenBSD/sun3</h2>

<hr>

<p>
The OpenBSD/sun3 port currently runs on all the 68020-based Sun3 computers, except the 3/E
flavour.

<h3><font color=#0000e0><strong>History and Status:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
The Sun3 port of OpenBSD was derived from the NetBSD/sun3 port, when the sun3 and sun3x
ports were still different entities. The tiny bits of OpenBSD that are
completely specific to the Sun3 port are basically the same as their NetBSD
counterparts.
</p>

<p>
<h3><font color=#0000e0>Supported Hardware:</font></h3>
OpenBSD/sun3 runs on the following Sun-3 models:
<ul>
<li> Sun-3/50
<li> Sun-3/60, 3/60LE
<li> Sun-3/75, 3/140, 3/150, 3/160 and 3/180
<li> Sun-3/110
<li> Sun-3/260 and 3/280
</ul>
Other Sun-3 models are NOT supported, especially 68030-based ones (<a href="sun3x.html">sun3x</a>).
</p>

<p>Supported devices:
<ul>
<li> On-board serial ports
<li> Sun type 3 keyboard and mouse
<li> On-board or VME video (bwtwo, cgtwo, cgfour)
<li> On-board or VME ethernet (intel, lance)
<li> On-board or VME sun-3 scsi controller, currently with some limitations
<li> VME xylogics cards are recognized but currently not working
</ul>
The sun-2 scsi controller is not supported yet.

<hr>
<p>
There is no formal OpenBSD/sun3 release yet.
Full snapshots, including userland, kernel, diskless and ufs bootstrap loaders
are available.
</p>

<p>
The diskless configuration is prone to instability.  If many processes
coredump during multi-user startup, hit &lt;L1-A&gt; and from the ``&gt;''
prompt use ``b le()bsd'' to reboot again.  It usually works on the second 
try. Alternatively, you can boot single-user ``b le()bsd -s'', and exit
single-user mode as soon as it appears with control-D.
This behaviour doesn't appear when running from a local harddisk.

<p>You can use <a href="anoncvs.html">cvs</a> to get The X Window System.
Kenneth Stailey had written patches for OpenBSD/sun3, which should have been
intergrated into the mainstream XFree86 sources. However, X has not been tested
on OpenBSD/sun3 for quite some time.

<h3><font color=#0000e0><strong>Projects being worked on (in no particular order):</strong></font></h3>
<ul>
<li>"call up" devices (/dev/cua*).
<li>sun-2 scsi (sc) driver.
<li>migrate the port from the VM memory system to UVM (in progress).
<li>rewrite the boot loader and installation procedures to share as much code
as possible with the sparc port.
</ul>
