<h2>OpenBSD/sun3</h2>

<hr>

<p>
The OpenBSD/sun3 port currently runs on all the 68020-based Sun3 computers, except the 3/E
flavour.

<h3><font color=#0000e0><strong>History and Status:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
The Sun3 port of OpenBSD was derived from the NetBSD/sun3 port, when the sun3 and sun3x
ports were still different entities. The tiny bits of OpenBSD that are
completely specific to the Sun3 port are basically the same as their NetBSD
counterparts.
</p>

<p>
<h3><font color=#0000e0>Supported Hardware:</font></h3>
OpenBSD/sun3 runs on the following Sun3 models:
<ul>
<li> Sun-3/50
<li> Sun-3/60, 3/60LE
<li> Sun-3/75, 3/140, 3/150, 3/160 and 3/180
<li> Sun-3/110
<li> Sun-3/260 and 3/280
</ul>
Other Sun3 models are NOT supported, especially 68030-based ones (<a href="sun3x.html">sun3x</a>).
OpenBSD will not run on 3/160 machines with only 2Mb of memory, and very
hardly on 4Mb machines.
</p>

<p>Supported devices:
<ul>
<li> On-board serial ports
<li> Sun type 3 keyboard and mouse
<li> On-board or VME video (bwtwo, cgtwo, cgfour)
<li> On-board or VME ethernet (intel, lance)
<li> On-board or VME sun-3 scsi controller, currently with some limitations
<li> VME xylogics cards are recognized but currently not working
</ul>
The sun-2 scsi controller is not supported yet.

<hr>
<p>
The complete OpenBSD/sun3 release is <a href=ftp.html>available via
ftp</a>; snapshots are made available on an irregular basis.<br>
You should read the
<a href=ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/sun3/INSTALL.sun3>installation
notes</a> for this release before trying to install OpenBSD/sun3.
</p>

<p>
The first boot of the system will take some time due to the generation of a DSA
key for ssh. This can take up to 15 minutes on a 3/160, but times can vary
greatly depending on your machine. This is a one time process and is nothing to
worry about.
</p>

<p>You can use <a href="anoncvs.html">cvs</a> to get The X Window System.
Kenneth Stailey had written patches for OpenBSD/sun3, which should have been
integrated into the mainstream XFree86 sources. X clients and libraries are
available, but there is no X server yet.
</p>

<h3><font color=#0000e0><strong>Projects being worked on (in no particular order):</strong></font></h3>
<ul>
<li>"call up" devices (/dev/cua*).
<li>sun-2 scsi (sc) driver.
<li>migrate the port from the VM memory system to UVM (in progress).
<li>rewrite the boot loader and installation procedures to share as much code
as possible with the sparc port.
</ul>
