<h2>OpenBSD/sun3</h2>

<hr>
<h3><strong>History and Status:</strong></h3>

<p>The tiny bits of OpenBSD that are completely specific to the Sun3
port are basically the same as their NetBSD counterparts but with some
additions. The major changes are:

<p>
<ul>
<li>default data resource limit raised to 16384 Kbytes so that "make build"
 does not crash in libc.
<li>/dev/leds derived from
 <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/cgi-bin/query-full-pr?2172">NetBSD pr#2172</a>
 by <a href="mailto:mouse@Collatz.McRCIM.McGill.EDU">der Mouse</a>.
</ul>

<hr><p>

Snapshots of the kernel and diskless bootstrap loader are available.
If you want to use OpenBSD/sun3 <a href="ftp.html">get an Amiga (or
<b>any</b> other m68k OpenBSD) snapshot and the Sun3 GENERIC kernel
and diskless bootstrap loader</a> then if you don't know how to set up
a diskless box read the <a href="diskless-8.html">diskless(8)</a>
manpage.  Use the MAKEDEV from <a href="ftp.html">src/etc.sun3</a>.
Once you have booted the Sun3 diskless you should be able to "cd
/usr/src; make obj; make build" to get a native OpenBSD/Sun3.
<B>Before doing this kernel instrumentation ("ps", "netstat", etc.)
will not work.</B>  

<p>The diskless configuration is prone to instability.  If many processes
coredump during multi-user startup, hit &lt;L1-A&gt; and from the ``&lt''
prompt use ``b le()bsd'' to reboot again.  It usually works on the second 
try for me.  With a local harddisk I have not noticed this behaviour yet.

<p>You can use <a href="anoncvs.html">cvs</a> to get The X Window System.
I have been told that my patches for OpenBSD/sun3 were integrated in it
but have not had time to test yet.  Additionally, a patch kit for XFree86
3.2 is available in the <a href="ftp.html"> snapshot directory.</a>
Look for xfree86-3.2-sun3-patch-kit-1.gz.

<h3><strong>Projects (in no particular order):</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>"call up" devices (/dev/cua*).
<li>An actual release.  If you are interested in helping and live outside
of the USA send E-mail to <a href="mailto:deraadt@openbsd.org">Theo.</a>
