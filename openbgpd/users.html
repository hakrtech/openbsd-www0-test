<i>Our customers expect us to maintain a high degree of performance,
security and control on our systems and network. At the same time we must
remain cost effective. The OpenBSD bgpd allows us to do exactly that,
and it forms a mission critical component of our business.
The skill and dedication we've seen from it's developers is unparalleled.</i>

<i>I first switched two of our routers from Zebra to OpenBGPD after
finding a problem we suspected was in Zebra.  As it turned out, the
problem itself was deep inside OpenBSD, solved in the then-current
kernel, but once I'd made the switch I liked what I saw and we've
stuck with OpenBGPD.<br>
I've found some bugs, but unlike in some other projects they were
resolved rather quickly in spite of being difficult to reproduce, and
OpenBGPD seems quite stable now.  Thanks, guys!

<i>We have been using OpenBSD for all of our routing, bridging, internet
servers, firewalls, VPN, etc. since we started the company.
Our growth had forced us to install a second fiber connection and
implement BGP.  We have been running bgpd on OpenBSD since August 2004,
and bgpd has been extremely stable.  To date, we have not had any
problems - it just works.  We run bgpd on a P3 866 with 512 MB of RAM.
We route over 800 GB of internet bound traffic every month.
We are very impressed with the work that the OpenBSD project does, and
we appreciate the quality, stability, functionality and security that
the operating system provides for us, but more important, we are
grateful and appreciate the hard work and dedication of the team. Thank
you OpenBSD.

<i>We were in the situation where we needed to upgrade from a Cisco 3600
due to the expanding bgp routing table and a seriously lacking cpu.  To
do what we needed to do would have required a Juniper or a high end
Cisco.  Instead we tried OpenBSD with OpenBGPD and pf on a low end
Opteron processor.  The result was nothing short of shocking!  Three
full views with 700 Meg of memory to spare.  CPU utilization between 5%
and 20%.  The ability to alter traffic filters using pf without
worrying about the CPU.  Full Unix-like environment with things like   
tcpdump.  In short, it's the best hardware, software decision we ever
made and it has literally changed the services we can offer.  I very
much prefer OpenBSD, OpenBGPD, and pf to any other solution.  It
actually brought tears to my eyes during our first few days of use.
It's that good.</i>

"Why tax a router with gathering statistical or operational data when
OpenBGPD can do it natively quickly and efficiently? OpenBGPD fulfills
the OpenBSD promise of providing reliability and security over flashy
buttons and knobs. I look with great interest at this project and have
high hopes for its continued success."

<i>I just wanted to tell  that I am a very happy user of
OpenBGPD (and OpenBSD for years). We started out with zebra on OpenBSD
2.8 or 2.9 and OpenBGPD since 3.8. Now we run OpenBSD 3.9 (since
yesterday) with OpenBGPD. Everything even remotely important
runs OpenBSD here ;)  We also provide bussinesses with dsl and
soekris/openbsd routers etc etc. We are moving to a new server room at
one of the facilities that host the AMS-IX (and NL-IX) exchanges and I
will set up redundant CARP/BGP (maybe OSPF) for our network there. We
have around 160 peers and three transit providers and my life is sooo
much easier than it was with zebra! Thanks dude!</i>
