<i>Our customers expect us to maintain a high degree of performance,
security and control on our systems and network. At the same time we must
remain cost effective. The OpenBSD bgpd allows us to do exactly that,
and it forms a mission critical component of our business.
The skill and dedication we've seen from it's developers is unparalleled.</i>

<i>I first switched two of our routers from Zebra to OpenBGPD after
finding a problem we suspected was in Zebra.  As it turned out, the
problem itself was deep inside OpenBSD, solved in the then-current
kernel, but once I'd made the switch I liked what I saw and we've
stuck with OpenBGPD.<br>
I've found some bugs, but unlike in some other projects they were
resolved rather quickly in spite of being difficult to reproduce, and
OpenBGPD seems quite stable now.  Thanks, guys!
