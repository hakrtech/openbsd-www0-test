<h2>OpenBSD/powerpc</h2>

<hr>
<h3><strong>Status:</strong></h3>

<p>
A snapshot for the powerpc has been made available.
This is still rather preliminary and should not be considered
finished, it is currently about beta level.
</p>

<p>
The port does not yet contain real device drivers. It currently uses
openfirmware for all device driver needs, console, disk, ethernet.
It can be installed from floppy and network or cdrom. Netboot and netroot
support is there but untested.
</p>

<p>
Currently known working hardware include the following Motorola machines
with OpenFirmware, PPC1bug firmware is known not to work:
<ul>
<li>Series E
<li>RiscPC
<li>Pro2000
<li>Pro3000
<li>Pro4000
<li>Pro6000
</ul>
Other machines that should work but are untested:
<ul>
<li> Firepower machines
<li> Motorola Net4000
<li> Motorola Net6000
</ul>
Machines that might work but are unlikely,
Macs with Openfirmware(PCI machines), and PPCP class machines.
Supported processors:
<ul>
<li>603
<li>603e
<li>604
<li>604ev
</ul>
</p>

<h3><strong>History:</strong></h3>

<p>
The powerpc specific portions of the kernel came from the NetBSD port
by Wolfgang Solfrank. The userland and build tools came from an
independant and incomplete port by Dale Rahn. Hopefully pieces
from that other port will be merged, device driver support for
interrupts and some real driver support.
The conversion to the Wolfgang port was done because it was running
multiuser and the other port was still single user out of memory ramdisk
(no fully working device drivers).
