<h2>OpenBSD/alpha</h2>

<hr>
<h3><font color=#0000e0><strong>History and Status:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
The alpha port was derived from the NetBSD/alpha port written by Chris
Demetriou <cgd@netbsd.org>.  Unfortunately we cannot track it closely anymore
as some copyright issues prevent us, check our <a href=policy.html>policy</a>
page for details.  We are making our own efforts to keep this port modern,
which also includes many userland 64 bit problems which we have tracked down
and made fixes to.  Many of the improvements mentioned below are not found
in NetBSD, but you should do your own research to decide which those are.
<p>
Initially the reason for existence of this port was to provide the OpenBSD
operating system to alpha users, i.e. no special effort was put in to develop
the port in the machine dependent parts.  The main thing that got done was to
ensure that all the tools needed to build a full system was included in the
tree, as well as updated with the changes Chris distributed in a separate
alpha toolchain package.
<p>
Today a lot more developers have got themselves alpha machines and we are
seeing interest in a more active port.  This fact has so far led to:
<ul>
<li>A large-scale attack at fixing remaining 64-bit 'long' vs 'int'
	problems in the entire userland source tree.  Most of these
	have been fixed, and new 64-bit problems are only rarely found.
<li>Adaption of the if_ed ethernet driver.
<li>Parsing of i386 MBR & disklabels.
<li>DDB (kernel debugger) (disassembler, tracebacks, single stepping).
<li>IDE & ATAPI support.
<li>Easy installation via floppy.
<li>Fixed VGA workstation console driver.  Added "stand-out" (highlight) to it too.
</ul>
<h3><font color=#0000e0><strong>Projects (in no particular order):</strong></font></h3>
<ul>
<li>ISA DMA (enables many common PC peripherals to be used)
<li>floppy support (requires ISA DMA).
<li>ELF object file format (gives shared libs)
</ul>
<p>
So far <a href="http://www.appli.se/niklas/">Niklas Hallqvist</a>
<a href=mailto:niklas@openbsd.org>&lt;niklas@openbsd.org&gt;</a> has been
keeping the port alive, but with the larger developer community coming up
this will hopefully be a more distributively (and better) maintained port.

<h3><font color=#0000e0><strong>Snapshots:</strong></font></h3>
<p>
OpenBSD/alpha saw its first proper release in OpenBSD 2.1.  Thomas Graichen
<a href=mailto:graichen@openbsd.org>&lt;graichen@openbsd.org&gt;</a>
has been creating OpenBSD/alpha snapshots from time to time. You may find them
on <a href=ftp.html>the usual OpenBSD ftp servers</a>.  Please talk to Thomas
if you are wondering over installation issues.
