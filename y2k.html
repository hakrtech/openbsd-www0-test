<h2>Year 2000 Compliance Statement.</h2>

<p>
As part of our <a href=security.html>security audit</a>, we've done
significant work to audit the source tree for <strong>Y2K</strong>
flaws.  When found, these were fixed before the 2.3 release shipped.
We feel that we were pretty thorough -- we even found problems in the
dating of nroff-generated manpages.

<p>
A non-comprehensive list of the problems we solved can be gleaned from
our Changelogs (available on the 2.3 CD in <strong>CD2:/Changelogs/</strong>)
or in web-based our <a href=plus.html>abbreviated daily log</a>.

<p>
At this time, we do not know of any Y2K flaws.  If anyone becomes aware
of a flaw which we missed, please inform our developers so that it can
be fixed.
