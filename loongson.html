<p>
OpenBSD/loongson is a port intended to run on systems based upon the
Loongson (also known as <i>Godson</i>) 2E and 2F MIPS-compatible processors,
using the
<a href="http://www.pmon2000.com/">PMON</a> firmware and boot loader.

<p>
The current port maintainer is Miod Vallat
(<a href="mailto:miod@openbsd.org">miod@openbsd.org</a>).

<a name="history"></a>
<h3><font color="#0000e0"><strong>History:</strong></font></h3>
<p>
The idea of an OpenBSD/loongson started when the EMTEC Gdium Liberty netbook
was announced. Unfortunately, the general availability of these machines kept
being delayed. Because of this, focus switched to the Lemote Yeeloong netbook
instead. After procrastinating for months, serious work started in august 2009,
and the kernel work was completed by the end of november 2009.
<p>
Unfortunately, most of the Loongson 2F-based hardware available at that time
suffers from serious problems in the processor's branch prediction logic,
causing the system to freeze, for which <b>no errata has been published</b>
except for an
<a href="http://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2009-11/msg00387.html">e-mail</a>
on a toolchain mailing-list.
<p>
After a rush of adding silicon problems workarounds, the port to the Lemote
Yeeloong was completed and self hosting by the end of january 2010.

<a name="hardware"></a>
<h3><font color="#0000e0"><strong>Supported hardware:</strong></font></h3>
<p>
The OpenBSD/loongson kernel has generic support for Loongson 2E and Loongson 2F
processors, as well as the 2F integrated PCI and memory controller.
Specific hardware support is then written on a design-by-design basis.
<p>
At the moment, the following machines are supported:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemote.com/english/yeeloong.html">Lemote Yeeloong</a>
<br>
Both the 8.9" and 10" models are supported.
All on-board devices but the audio controller are supported.
</ul>

<a name="status"></a>
<h3><font color="#0000e0"><strong>Current status:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
Development is currently pretty hectic at the moment, although it will slow
down in preparation for the first OpenBSD/loongson release.
<p>
All supported systems run multiuser, and a currently unaccelerated
X server is available.

<hr>
<a name="projects"></a>
<h3><font color="#0000e0"><strong>Projects (in no particular order):
</strong></font></h3>

<ul>
<li>Better workarounds for the 2F problems.
<li>Write a PMON-based bootloader able to load the kernel from a BSD filesystem,
instead of having to put the kernel file on a Linux filesystem.
<li>Write support for the onboard audio controller on Yeeloong.
<li>Port to other Loongson-based machines, such as the Gdium Liberty netbook and
the Lemote Fuloong mini-PC.
</ul>
