<em>
Join Puffy Hood and his Funny Fish as they take on
the Sherriff (an unelected leader) and other evil
forces of the draconian government!
<p>
<br>
As we did for the 3.3 release, we have once again tried
making release artwork and music which are allegorical
of recent happenings.
<p>
Two years ago we became involved with the University
of Pennsylvania and DARPA, who were funding us to do
security research and development .. on things that
we were already intending to do.  We provided ideas,
wrote papers, and deployed cutting-edge technology;
DARPA provided finances and reaped a share of the
credit, and the University of Pennsylvania acted as
a middle-man.  We accepted funding based on the
promise that our freedom to operate as we wished
was unaffected. To us, freedom is more important
than funding -- heck, we were dealing with the evil
forces of government, and needed to be careful.
<p>
A few months prior to this release, DARPA suddenly
and without warning decided to withdraw that funding;
they also aggressively backed out of contractual
obligations.  Many articles in the <a href=press.html>press</a> followed regarding
this sudden manuevre.  Apparently this hoopla happened
because an OpenBSD-related article in the Canadian
newspaper The Globe & Mail had quoted Theo de Raadt
making anti-war statements regarding Iraq and the
theft of oil.
<p>
The only answer given (to major media reporters) by a
DARPA spokesperson (Jan Walker) was this:
<p>
&quot;As a result of the DARPA review of the
project, and due to world events and the evolving
threat posed by increasingly capable nation-states,
the Government on April 21 advised the University
to suspend work on the "security fest" portion of
the project.&quot;
<p>
That almost toes the line of calling us terrorists!
We had lost financial support, but the release of the
statement above suddenly made us very happy to be free
of any perceived obligation to such crazy people.
<p>
Since the termination came near natural contract
termination (about 4 months remained), less damage
than expected was sustained by the project.  Sponsors
stepped forward and helped us make up the missing funds
we needed to run our "Hackathon", and the event
proceeded as planned.  We even had t-shirts made with
"Workstations of Mass Development" artwork for those
developers who attended (sorry, they are not for sale).
<p>
We could not make stories like this up.  So instead,
we are making up an allegory about it, using the tale
of Robin Hood.

<br>
Sir Puffy of Ramsay was a wandrin'<br>
Through forests of seaweed all alone<br>
He had found the crusades<br>
were an endless charade<br>
So for now he called Nothing Hack home<br>
<br>
<br>
One day he met Little Bob of Beckley<br>
Beat him fair on a log-in by staff<br>
Clever chums they did find<br>
other fish of their kind<br>
Thwarting evil with humppa and math<br>
<br>
<br>
Now trouble was a brewin' when the Good King was away<br>
The Sheriff came a callin' for the poor to pay<br>
With CD's and their freedom<br>
for to share online<br>
And burning down the village cause he was a slime<br>
<br>
<br>
So Puffy and his buddies took the booty from the rich<br>
and turned it into a system to protect poor fish<br>
Sent out by Hook or a Wim<br>
to the teaming schools<br>
Town cryers were on fire cause the crypto ruled!<br>
<br>
<br>
<em>Chorus:</em><br>
They called it "BSD"!<br>
And "Open" because it's always free<br>
So raise up your glass and<br>
three cheers to the Funny<br>
Fish for never running<br>
and making something good!<br>
And here's to Puffy Hood!<br>
<br>
<br>
Aaaw! Word to the sea y'all<br>
The Hood's a bad ball<br>
Ya underneath he's a heathen and a traitor<br>
He can take from you all and say "later!"<br>
Think he's a hero?<br>
Naw he ain't lovin' ya<br>
He gettin' richer than Bill Gates and Dubya<br>
Read the Wanted poster<br>
of Sheriff Plac-o-derm fool<br>
We gettin' back the booty<br>
or we take away your worms too<br>
<br>
<br>
Yo! Word to the classes<br>
Put on your glasses<br>
I guess the Sheriff is King till this passes<br>
Times are a changin' and movin' so fast<br>
 He says "Give me your freedom,<br>
I'll grasp it and pass it to brass<br>
who can hash it for weapons of massive distraction.<br>
And hand me the bastards that brashly amassed from the cash<br>
happy faction of oily and gassy co-action".<br>
No! Don't hand em dick, grab a stick, keep attacking for freedom<br>
and hack till the King cometh back and leave em'<br>
<br>
<br>
Then trouble was a rollin' with an army on the run<br>
The Sheriff came a callin' for the spikey one<br>
And took back all the booty<br>
Puff intended for the poor<br>
The Arch-a-thon went on despite the mighty roar<br>
<br>
<br>
Puff snuck into the castle, and found the treasure hill<br>
And also found Maid Marlin held against her will<br>
He loaded all the loot<br>
 to give it back and big surprise<br>
He took the maiden too, 'cause she was easy on the eyes<br>
<br>
<br>
<em>Chorus:</em><br>
They called it "BSD"!<br>
And "Open" because it's always free<br>
So raise up your glass and<br>
three cheers to the Funny<br>
Fish for never running<br>
and making something good!<br>
And here's to Puffy Hood!<br>

Like other Barbarians before him, Puff has had to face<br>
some pretty crazy challenges.<br>
<br>
This song is an allegory of the recent difficulties<br>
we went through dealing with Sun, who refused our<br>
request for documentation about their UltraSPARC III<br>
processors.  We want documentation, because these are<br>
the fastest processors with a per-page eXecute bit<br>
in the MMU, needed to fully support our new W^X<br>
security feature.  In the meantime, the AMD Hammer<br>
has come onto the scene, and this processor supports<br>
an eXecute bit in 64-bit mode.  And it is going to<br>
be faster...<br>

Deep through the mists of time<br>
Gaze to the crystal ball<br>
Back to the age of darkness<br>
Black was the protocol<br>
<p>
A King ruled the web with fear<br>
Spilling the blood of men<br>
Then from the ocean came<br>
Puff the Barbarian<br>
<br>
<br>
Born in a tiny bowl Puff was a pet<br>
Sold into slav-er-y by the man<br>
Eating the weeds till he was strong enough<br>
Breaking his bonds like nobody can<br>
<p>
Down the sewer pipes of Hell<br>
A thousand kitties then did bleed<br>
Constraints were slain as well<br>
Hacked his way out to the C<br>
<p>
And there he found<br>
His destiny<br>
Hammer of the Ocean God<br>
"Xor taking care of me"<br>
<p>
Then in a dream Xor requested he<br>
"Go to the Sun King, get what I yearn<br>
Kernighan saw it, prophet of the C<br>
Knowledge - so they may never return"<br>
<p>
At the tower Puff appealed<br>
For the wisdom of the One<br>
Denied, his mind did reel<br>
Puff was getting tired of Sun<br>
<p>
Broke down the guard<br>
Cause math is hard<br>
Saw McNealy on his throne<br>
All alone and only bones<br>
<p>
Come the Sun King blade ablur<br>
Hammer down eclipse the Sun<br>
And Puff, the land secured<br>
The new King Barbarian!<br>
