This song is an allegory of the recent difficulties<br>
we went through dealing with Sun, who refused our<br>
request for documentation about their UltraSPARC III<br>
processors.  We want documentation, because these are<br>
the fastest processors with a per-page eXecute bit<br>
in the MMU, needed to fully support our new W^X security<br>
feature.  In the meantime, the AMD Hammer has come<br>
onto the scene, and this processor supports an eXecute<br>
bit in 64-bit mode.  And it is going to be faster...<br>

Deep through the mists of time<br>
Gaze to the crystal ball<br>
Back to the age of darkness<br>
Black was the protocol<br>
<p>
A King ruled the web with fear<br>
Spilling the blood of men<br>
Then from the ocean came<br>
Puff the Barbarian<br>
<p>
Born in a tiny bowl Puff was a pet<br>
Sold into slav-er-y by the man<br>
Eating the weeds till he was strong enough<br>
Breaking his bonds like nobody can<br>
<p>
Down the sewer pipes of Hell<br>
A thousand kitties then did bleed<br>
Constraints were slain as well<br>
Hacked his way out to the C<br>
<p>
And there he found<br>
His destiny<br>
Hammer of the Ocean God<br>
"Xor taking care of me"<br>
<p>
Then in a dream Xor requested he<br>
"Go to the Sun King, get what I yearn<br>
Kernighan saw it, prophet of the C<br>
Knowledge - so they may never return"<br>
<p>
At the tower Puff appealed<br>
For the wisdom of the One<br>
Denied, his mind did reel<br>
Puff was getting tired of Sun<br>
<p>
Broke down the guard<br>
Cause math is hard<br>
Found McNealy on his throne<br>
All alone and only bones<br>
<p>
Come the Sun King blade ablur<br>
Hammer down eclipse the Sun<br>
And Puff, the land secured<br>
The new King Barbarian!<br>

Goldflipper<br>
With golden skin<br>
and flippers as sharp as a knife<br>
He's the machine<br>
Designed to dismember your life<br>

And the fish<br>
Protecting us all from the cat<br>
And the cat<br>
Infecting the wo-orld for a laugh<br>

Cyborg on a mission<br>
To do some Puff fishin'<br>
The doctor wants fugu tonight!<br>

(short instrumental intro)
<p>
You'll need some machismo to<br>
catch the spikey one<br>
He's got guts and gizmos to<br>
make the system run<br>
<p>
But Flip's here for fun<br>
and without a gun<br>
He'll dice you with his Golden fin<br>
<p>
She's all over Puff cause he's<br>
such a sexy catch<br>
Is she spying on him or<br>
just a seafood match?<br>
<p>
Oh double seven<br>
Send me to Heaven<br>
Cause for Mr. Po-o-o-ond<br>
<p>
The women are fond<br>
She knows what to do<br>
She'll turn Gold to goo<br>

Goldflipper is gone<br>
Gold flipper's goooooooooooooone<br>
