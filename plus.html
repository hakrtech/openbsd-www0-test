<h3>Changes made between OpenBSD versions.</h3>

<p>
The OpenBSD project was spawned from NetBSD (a member of the 4.4BSD
family) and is developed separately.  As well as developments by our
development group, good changes from the other free operating systems
are evaluated and merged into OpenBSD.  We track bug reports and
source tree changes from the NetBSD and FreeBSD projects fairly
closely.  Even pieces of code from the Linux projects have been used.

<p>
In the early days of OpenBSD, it was possible to be able to say
"OpenBSD is NetBSD PLUS MORE STUFF".  Now, after the substantial work
the group members have done, OpenBSD is very much is it's own thing.
Too much stuff has been added and fixed to easily compare it to
something else.  OpenBSD is OpenBSD.

<p>
This is a partial list of the major machine independent changes
(ie. these are the changes people ask about most often).  Port
specific changes have also been made, and are sometimes mentioned
in the pages for the specific <a href=plat.html>ports</a> if you
are interested in for further port-specific details.  Many ports
have had architecture-specific enhancements relative to NetBSD,
but when they do not they certainly have plenty of platform-independent
changes, starting with those listed below..

<p>
<h3><font color=#0000e0>Life for the OpenBSD project begins...</font></h3>
<p>
<ul>

        libraries except for the gnu stuff (where, based on preliminary
        inspection there is poor handling of temp files).
<li>Working Linux ext2fs.
<li>Added sudo (which is maintained by one of our developers)
<li>CTM is now a supported way of obtaining OpenBSD source code.
</ul>
<p>
<h3><font color=#0000e0>OpenBSD 2.0 released.</font></h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The NIST Posix test suite became free. As a result we have been correcting

	POSIX compliant very soon.
<li>upgrade to CVS version 1.9.
<li>A number of security fixes to the way coredumping works.
<li>The /dev/*random devices are now default on all architectures.
<li>Add stack tracebacks to Arc port's kernel debugger.
<li>Skey revamped into full OTP (RFC1938) support, including sha1 and
	md5 support.
<li>GPL i387 emulator added.
<li>Crank kvm space on the i386 port, also limit buffer cache useage
	so that 512MB machines may work (untested :-)
<li>Numerous fixes to the lpr suite, including security.
<li>More ftpd raging paranoia security fixes.
<li>The NIST suite showed numerous errors in libraries and the kernel.
	Only a few small errors remain now, mostly regarding serial
	ports.
<li>In numerous utilities: prefer $LOGNAME, but also accept $USER.
<li>OLF binary type added.  This is like ELF, but includes an OS-dependent
	tag. elf2olf(1) converts an elf binary to a tagged OLF binary which
	the kernel can recognize correctly.
<li>Beware $HOME overflows throughout the source tree.
<li>Integration of the pmax port.
<li>Import of ctm.
<li>Various repairs to the scsi scanner support.
<li>Numerous more difficult-to-exploit-but-possible-if-someone-really-wanted-to
	buffer overflows found in system utilities..

<li>Make login get more consistantly upset about failed logins, and tell user
	about these failures at the next successful login.
<li>pdksh version is now 5.2.11
<li>New bsd.*.mk feature: DEBUG=-g.  Try it, you'll like it.
<li>The Arc port family has a new member: The rPC44 works! 
<li>lpt driver is now bus-independent.
<li>com driver is now bus-independent.
<li>Numerous small security fixes again...
<li>Use pdksh as our /bin/sh.  This provides excellent POSIX compliance.
<li>Prevent generic users from mounting filesystems by default.
<li>Added -C option to pax/tar. Also made -z support compressed files too.
<li>Increased compatibility in the pccons driver with BSDi features.
<li>Imported FreeBSD's calendar.
<li>GNU gdb works on the mips-based platforms.
<li>Add FreeBSD md5 diffs to mtree(8).  This can be used to implement a
	tripwire-like system.
<li>Some YP and bootparamd security changes.
<li>Hundreds of little fixes all over the place.
<li>Multiple updates for GNU software
<li>Add disklabels to the floppy device drivers.
<li>At boottime, have (*mountroot)() look at the root device's disklabel
	to determine which filesystem type is to be mounted.
<li>If disklabel reading code discovers an ISOFS filesystem underlying,
	spoof a nice disklabel (enough to fool mountroot).
<li>tcpdump 3.3
<li>Fix information gathering attack in ping(8).
<li>Add NetBSD's "route show" implementation, and at the same time fix
	the new buffer overflows that this provided.
<li>Fix a few setgroups() related security holes.
<li>sendmail 8.8.4
<li>texinfo 3.9
<li>f77 0.5.19
<li>Repair some more KerberosIV buffer overflows.  Hard to believe this is
	supposed to be security software.
<li>Add XCASE/IUCLC/OLCUC/OCRNL/ONOCR/ONLRET tty subsystem flags for
	backwards compatibility.
<li>Permit NFS attribute cache to be configured on a per-mount basis.
<li>Properly split fsck, mount, and newfs into multiple pieces.  Use
	disklabel information if it is available.
<li>Add disklabels to the vnd device driver.
<li>Change the games to be run setgid games, not setuid games.  This closes
	a whole slew of fascinating security holes.
<li>Import of the powerpc port.
<li>Properly use _POSIX_SAVED_IDS throughout the source tree.
<li>Permit building of kernels without a.out support.
<li>ppp 2.3b3
<li>libcrypt goes away. We do not need this stub library anymore. Do not link
	against it on OpenBSD, all the pieces you need are in libc.
<li>new aucat command.
<li>Fix a fairly nasty security hole in all of the games.
<li>Support for the <a href="hp300.html">hp300</a> added.
<li>Upgrade of awk(1), integration of BSD tsort(1), getopt fixes.

<li>Added lchown(2) for compatibility with SVR4 implementations.
<li>New gnu cpio 2.4.2
<li>Support lchown(2) in dump(8), cp(1), pax(1), cpio(1), chown(8), and
	restore(8).

<li>various adjtime() corrections inside the kernel.
<li>Prevent stat() from disclosing inode generation numbers to non-root userland.
<li>pax in tar mode will understand multiple -v options to generate ls-like output.
<li>Repair many uses of the SIOCGIFCONF code for machines with an outrageous
	number of network interfaces.
<li>More kerberosIV security patches.
<li>A working fsirand.
<li>Completely in-tree <a href="powerpc.html">PowerPC</a> port for non-Apple
	hardware.  This port requires nothing outside the in-tree development
	environment to build (except mkisofs for building distributions).
<li>Some ypbind(8) tightening up, includes a method to specify a list of
	valid servers
<li>Bug fixed that prevented bufpages/nbuf > 1 setups.  This allows large
	buffer caches even when available kvm space is low, like for i386
	& sparc.
<li>Changed netinet IP_HDRINCL option to require ip_len and ip_off in network
	byte order. This is a compatibility/portability fix and we expect
	other BSD systems to eventually follow suit.
<li>amd (the automounter) is now 64-bit and working on the alpha.
<li>The <a href="alpha.html">Alpha</a> port and all it's utilities now compiles
	using in-tree versions of all tools.  Yipee!
<li>A SA_SIGINFO implementation for sigaction() and signal handlers.  This is a
	small part of POSIX 1003.1b and permits the signal handler to figure
	out the exact cause of a signal; such as fault address information
	for SIGSEGV or more detailed information for SIGFPE.
<li>config.old(8) has been removed from the tree, as the <a href="hp300.html">
	hp300</a> port switches to config(8).
<li>/sbin/dump -a saves you from needing to deal with finicky tape length
	options (from FreeBSD)
<li>Added RFC-1812 ICMP unreachable codes to ip_icmp.h, traceroute, and ping.
<li>Be more careful if some fool decides to enable source routing ;-)
<li>Support for gzip'd kernels in some bootblocks.
<li>New wgrisc port for Willowglen embedded r3081-based machine with ISA slots.
<li>Add cdev and partition support to the ramdisk driver.
<li>Merge new ftp(1) changes from NetBSD.
<li>Change mktemp(3) and family to generate more random filenames, yet still
	as collision free as possible.
<li>Have libc/rpc save you from yourself if you do enable source routing. 
<li>The <a href="hp300.html">hp300</a> joins many other ports in supporting
	16 disk partitions.
<li>IPF 3.1.7 which includes fully working NAT support (ie. IP masquerading).
<li>Use lots more XXXX characters in calls to the few remaining mktemp() calls
	in the source tree. This cuts out a whole class of races. 
<li>Improved NFS filehandle creation.
<li>Make dd(1) work fine with our 64-bit off_t types, now you can copy very
	large disks using it.
<li>add RPC service name generation to netstat -a
<li>Fix pax & tar to be POSIX compliant.
<li>Fix a few netinet kernel crash problems.
<li>Fix so that stack limits which are not a multiple of the pagesize work.
<li>fix some more memory and file descriptor leaks in libc/rpc
<li>New scalable BLOWFISH-based crypt algorithm for passwd file entries. It
	uses a very large strong-random `salt' and the number of rotor
	runs is configurable.  Hence if you have faster machines you can
	slow the crypt routine down and make harder keys.
<li>Add support for /etc/passwd.conf which controls the format and strength
	of passwd entries for the next time a user changes their password.
	These options can be set per-user.
<li>Working kadmind for kerberosIV. 
<li>IPSEC package from John Ioannidis and Angelos D. Keromytis.
<li>cvs 1.9.2
<li>Fix weak symbol support in ld.
<li>libg++ pulls in libcurses automatically.
<li>Replace which(1) with a C program.
<li>newfs(8) now has an inline fsirand(8) with no noticable speed decrease.
<li>settimeofday(2) won't roll back the date if securelevel > 0 (from lite2).
<li>deroff(1) 1.0 from Debian (a Linux).
<li>BIND 4.9.5-P1.
<li>Add support for FreeBSD md5 to /etc/passwd.conf.
<li>Import of the mvme88k kernel port.
<li>Import of libwrap and tcpd (tcp wrappers).
<li>Numerous improvements to pax, including full support for cpio and
	a lot of fixes to tar mode.
<li>Let fsck and fsirand automatically work on very large filesystems.
<li>Various fixes to the fsck tools.
<li>ipsecadm as an initial cut at controlling IPSEC sessions.
<li>Fix pcmcia on the i386.
<li>Merged changes from at 2.9 into our own at.
<li>pccon(1) to control the pccons driver.
<li>Bye bye tahoe bits.
<li>noaccesstime option for filesystems (saves batteries on laptops)
<li>Substantial changes and fixes to the scsi scanner support.
<li>Support for "secure" YP password maps.
<li>Various atm fixes.
<li>The NE2000 if_ed driver now works on the alpha, too.
<li>ddb improvements for 64 bit machines.
<li>Fixes to fts(3).
<li>A few ypbind fixes.
<li>sysctl kern.osrevision gives OpenBSD date.
<li>gcc no longer defines -D__NetBSD__, only -D__OpenBSD__ now!
<li>Implement NOFILE_MAX--hard limit on max descriptors per process.
<li>Be more careful about modes of lost+found directories.
<li>New termcap and terminfo database files.
<li>Change mail.local -H behaviour slightly, and convince mail(1) to use it
	for correct locking!
<li>64 bit clean in.rarpd.
<li>cvs 1.9.6
<li>16 partition support for the alpha port.
<li>Add ./.message support to ftpd
<li>Numerous more pax/tar fixes.
<li>Add md5 & blowfish passwd support to adduser(8).
<li>Add support for YP v1 to ypserv.
<li>Fixed some more mktemp races (sigh, will this ever end!) 
<li>More buffer overflows, but none in sensitive programs.
<li>getnetent() and friends now work a lot more like gethostent().
<li>Use 10 X characters in many remaining mktemp() calls which are
	hard to excise.
<li>Solve a few resolver problems after the recent 4.9.5-P1 integration,
	not all our fault.
<li>Fix patch to honour Index lines better.
<li>A whole bunch of 64 bit fixes in the source tree (hint: alpha).
<li>Once again, really correct the various source routing pieces of the
	userland source tree.
<li>Make real i386 cpu's work again. In case noone noticed, they didn't
	work for about 5 months.  The bug was very hard to find...
<li>For config(8), if any kernel options get added/deleted/changed since
	the previous commit, warn that the compile tree needs 'make clean'.
<li>Use in_addr_t and in_port_t all over the place.
<li>Correct DEV_BSIZE and lp->d_secsize confusion throughout the source
	tree. CD9660 is much happier now.
<li>Fix AFS string-to-key handling in kerberos.
<li>NAT now gets started from /etc/netstart.
<li>Various man page fixes.

<li>Signal handling fix to crontab(1).
<li>Unify naming of architecture names between gcc & binutils.
<li>Some more userland 64 bit fixes.
<li>Support for PCI NE2000 clones.
<li>libpthread works on the m68k.
<li>Significantly improved the unpredictability of the DNS packet id's
	in the resolver and named.
<li>newfs_msdos(8) can has enough brains to find the partition size itself.
<li>Split rc.local, creating rc.securelevel. (Securelevels look like a worse
	and worse idea every month).
<li>A bit more man page cleanup starting to happen...
<li>GNU Groff 1.10 with (improved) Makefile wrapper.
<li>sleep(3) and usleep(3) now call nanosleep(2) for significantly less
	overhead.
<li>The vnd(4) device has a new safer mode of operation called svnd
	where you can trust a disk-image right after it's unmounted,
	i.e. cache-coherency.
<li>Repaired install stuff for most architectures significantly, improving
	ftp/http installs, single bootable install floppies, and in some
	cases CDROM booting.  Most floppies contain vi, too.
<li>Support crunch on arc (for bootable installs).
<li>Added gzip and cdrom support to the sparc and alpha bootblocks.
<li>Fix keyboard and delay timing in i386 bootfloppy bootblocks. Whee!
