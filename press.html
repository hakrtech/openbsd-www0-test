Linux Weekly News security editor Liz Coolbaugh picks up on a Bugtraq thread

Rich Morin puts the 80's UNIX history of fragmentation in perspective by
examining the creative tensions between the five operating systems derived 
from 4.4BSD-Lite. Rather than repeating the platitude of how the BSD-derived
operating systems should unite, Morin's Silicon Carny column shows that the
projects and companies cooperate even though they have diverging goals. And
now that Sun has cautiously moved to open source some of its source, how
will the open source world react, he asks.

Linux probably cannot achieve the same level of security audit.

Guest columnist Brett Arquette points out that Linux isn't the only alternative
PC OS out there, then describes why hardware drivers and end user support is
crucial to popularising an OS. He mentions OpenBSD and adds a link to this
site.<p>

This report compares the network monitoring performance of the
<a href="http://www.nfr.net">NFR (Network Flight Recorder)</a> package at
handling flat-out 100Mbit ethernet monitoring, running on OpenBSD, BSDI,
Linux, and Solaris.  OpenBSD comes out as a clear winner just for raw
performance; even before you consider the superior security of OpenBSD
which you probably would want for a network-monitoring station.

A system administrator debunks the myth that you must use NT as a file server
when you run Windows clients. Squeezing performance out of vintage hardware and
adding in some scripts to automate the setup of new projects won management 
over to OpenBSD.

"Finally, we'd be remiss in ignoring OpenBSD in any discussion of top

columns."

Radio, August 2, 2000
</strong></font><br>

Bartek Rozkrut (aka Madey), made a guest appearance on LinuxRadio, speaking
about differences betwen OpenBSD and Linux. During the show, listeners were
able to comment and ask questions on IRCNET's #linuxnews channel. The main
criticism was that OpenBSD doesn't support SMP and isn't available for the
IA-64 platform. LinuxNEWS is the biggest polish Linux news service, covering
the entire Linux scene in Poland.<br>
<i>Here's the <a href="http://urtica.linuxnews.pl/radio/audycja7.mp3">MP3</a></i>.

<i>OpenBSD - Nothing but advantages?</i>, LinuxNews Serwis Informacyjny,
January 2000
</strong></font><br>

Bartek Rozkrut combines an overview of OpenBSD with a review of how to
download and install the system. He mentions Theo de Raadt's "craze"
about security and how he frustrates Linux advocates on Bugtraq with
mails like "the problem was fixed a year ago in OpenBSD".
The author spends some time explaining the disklabel partitioning scheme and 
reassuring would-be users that the no-frills installation script actually
works even though it doesn't have a fancy point & click interface. He even
gives typical download times from the various national ISPs.<br>
