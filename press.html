</strong></font><p>

Technology writer Simson L. Garfinkel confesses he prefers the BSDs better
than Linux and explains why. He writes a nice paragraph or two about OpenBSD 
and its security and cryptography goals. However, reading this, you'd think 
all the developers were Canadian (hint: they're not).<p>

The article starts off as a personal story about lead developer Theo de Raadt, 
but if you read carefully, it does explain a lot about the origins and goals 
of OpenBSD.<p>

This report compares the network monitoring performance of the
<a href="http://www.nfr.net">NFR (Network Flight Recorder)</a> package at
handling flat-out 100Mbit ethernet monitoring, running on OpenBSD, BSDI,
Linux, and Solaris.  OpenBSD comes out as a clear winner just for raw
performance; even before you consider the superior security of OpenBSD
which you probably would want for a network-monitoring station.

A system administrator debunks the myth that you must use NT as a file server
when you run Windows clients. Squeezing performance out of vintage hardware and
adding in some scripts to automate the setup of new projects won management 
over to OpenBSD.
