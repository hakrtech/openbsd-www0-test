Yet another article on the DARPA moves, this time from down under.
Days before the grant was recalled, Jonathan M. Smith told de Raadt
that "perceptions of wrong doing" were very important to UPENN.  When
papers around the world start making assertions of wrong doing on
UPENN and DARPA's part, how is that for perception?<br>

Then on some news sites, the story starts to change.  A spokeswoman
from DARPA is quoted as saying "We're sorry if this review process has
been misinterpreted as an effort to cancel the work."  (If it was not
a cancellation, then why did Mark West from UPENN phone the Hyatt
Calgary and cancel the reservations -- even before OpenBSD was
informed by Jonathan Smith, who in email said "Penn has been contacted
by the Air Force and NO FURTHER COSTS MAY BE INCURRED, effective
today, 4/17/03", "All subcontracts are terminated, effective TODAY",
and "Penn must cancel/terminate contracts &amp; obligations such as the
Hyatt and travel not yet PAID. Mark, please carry this out ASAP per
our contractual requirements with the government" These papers proceed
to pick up the new story; some retain the old one:

DARPA Awards Computer Scientists $2.1 Million to Integrate Security Features into Mainstream Computers</a>.
</strong></font><br>
The original announcement from the University of Pennsylvania about
the cooperative effort with OpenBSD et al with DARPA funding:
"During the last few decades, the government's approach has been
to contract researchers to develop high-security workstations
specifically for its own uses, outside of the mainstream computer
industry," said [Prof. Jonathan] Smith, Professor of Computer and Information 
Science at Penn.  "The problem is that development of these special-purpose
computers has generally progressed so slowly that the machines,
while indeed secure, are technically obsolete by the time they are
put into service."
<p>
"Smith and colleagues at Penn, the software development consortium
OpenBSD, and the Apache Software Foundation and OpenSSL Group
propose to use the open-source movement - where programmers openly
share incremental advances - to try to engineer better security
features into mainstream computers, not only those developed just
for the military and other high-security organizations.  The
government then benefits by purchasing more affordable, standardized
computers with security features."

Following Microsoft's purposed announcement to address

OpenBSD as the only example known to him of an OS which is
regularly audited for security problems in its source code.
He warns other Operating Systems to start taking security as a

OpenBSD has had, other OS developers might find themselves in
a bad position soon.</em>&quot;<br>

can develop into security holes:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&quot;Unlike

rather than reactive to security problems.&quot;</em><br>

solutions whereas they are options to be installed and applied
on other operating systems.<br>

removing stuff, not by adding more junk&quot;</em> in that
it's easier to keep something simple secure.

We really like Simson when he writes <i>&quot;But if you're trying to get the
most for your money or if you want a higher level of security, take a look at
the BSDs. The rewards can be considerable.&quot;</i> But he misses the point 
about strong crypto because of the fuss over 128-bit browsers. The RSA patent
has been a more effective muzzle on innovation than the export prohibitions.

"IPsec may be an open standard, but that's no guarantee that different 
vendors' gear will work together. To assess interoperability, we put an even
dozen products through their paces." OpenBSD 2.4 and commercial IPsec 
implementations were tested by an independent lab for interoperability
and ease in setting up tunneling gateways.

In a review of this year's event subtitled &quot;USENIX

conference in 1979 to the recent one in Montery, California. Although it
only mentions OpenBSD in the links section below the article, it's still
an interesting read.
