Stephan Somogyi reviews the latest issue with the IPF licence and
examines why the OpenBSD team made the decision of removing it from
its source tree altogether.  But <em>&quot;code talks, and OpenBSD has

what message does that send about that system's resistance to less trivial

OpenBSD's Bugtraq disclosure of a localhost vulnerability . He gets
at the point of the source code audit: it's not to find exploitable
holes, but rather to fix bugs so that they never become security

Sean Sosik-Hamor describes how he built up his own Internet resource provider 
(IRP) and web hosting business out of available hardware and freenix 
software. He chose OpenBSD exclusively for his DMZ and describes the FTP 
installation.

what message does that send about that system's resistance to less trivial

Bartek Rozkrut (aka Madey), made a guest appearance on LinuxRadio, speaking
about differences between OpenBSD and Linux. During the show, listeners were
able to comment and ask questions on IRCNET's #linuxnews channel. The main
criticism was that OpenBSD doesn't support SMP and isn't available for the
IA-64 platform. LinuxNEWS is the biggest polish Linux news service, covering
the entire Linux scene in Poland.<br>

Bartek Rozkrut combines an overview of OpenBSD with a review of how to
download and install the system. He mentions Theo de Raadt's "craze"
about security and how he frustrates Linux advocates on Bugtraq with
mails like "the problem was fixed a year ago in OpenBSD".
The author spends some time explaining the disklabel partitioning scheme and 
reassuring would-be users that the no-frills installation script actually
works even though it doesn't have a fancy point & click interface. He even
gives typical download times from the various national ISPs.<br>
