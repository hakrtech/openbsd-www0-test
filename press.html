A Secure and Open Society</a>,
ComputerWorld Canada, Aug 27, 1999.</strong></font><p>

The article starts off as a personal story about lead developer Theo de Raadt, 
but if you read carefully, it does explain a lot about the origins and goals 
of OpenBSD.<p>

NFR Performance Testing</a> report, written by

This report compares the network monitoring performance of the
<a href="http://www.nfr.net">NFR (Network Flight Recorder)</a> package at
handling flat-out 100Mbit ethernet monitoring, running on OpenBSD, BSDI,
Linux, and Solaris.  OpenBSD comes out as a clear winner just for raw
performance; even before you consider the superior security of OpenBSD
which you probably would want for a network-monitoring station.

"Finally, we'd be remiss in ignoring OpenBSD in any discussion of top
open-source security products. It registered high in our e-mail
survey, and we promise to take a more active look at it in future
columns."

A glowing four-page description of OpenBSD emphasizing its use
as a server and an OS that ships with security in the box

graphic - a cross between Superman&#153; and the BSD Daemon, which
the WebServer version in HTML does not).
