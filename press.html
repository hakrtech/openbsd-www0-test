Why to BSD in a Linux world.</a></strong></font>, March, 1999<p>

Description of the OpenBSD development process, and arguments as to why
Linux probably cannot achieve the same level of security audit.

NFR Performance Testing</a> report, written by
<a href="http://www.anzen.com">Anzen</a>.  February, 1999.</strong></font><p>

This report compares the network monitoring performance of the
<a href="http://www.nfr.net">NFR (Network Flight Recorder)</a> package at
handling flat-out 100Mbit ethernet monitoring, running on OpenBSD, BSDI,
Linux, and Solaris.  OpenBSD comes out as a clear winner just for raw
performance; even before you consider the superior security of OpenBSD
which you probably would want for a network-monitoring station.

"Finally, we'd be remiss in ignoring OpenBSD in any discussion of top
open-source security products. It registered high in our e-mail
survey, and we promise to take a more active look at it in future
columns."

OpenBSD and IPSec, leading the pack</a>, November, 1998.
</strong></font><p>

A two-part article by Ejovi Nuwere focusing on OpenBSD's IPSec Development.
Part one is an introduction to OpenBSD's Photurisd and its current
Implementation, including a brief interview with
Photurisd creator Neils Provos.

Completely bogus (but quite amusing) description of what
OpenBSD is.

Server/Workstation Expert (formerly

A glowing four-page description of OpenBSD emphasizing its use
as a server and an OS that ships with security in the box
(the SunExpert version is in PDF but includes their own
graphic - a cross between Superman&#153; and the BSD Daemon, which
the WebServer version in HTML does not).

Two published letters talking about OpenBSD's role in MacOS X.  The 1st
