Technology reporter Matthew McClearn interviewed system administrators and 
security specialists in Calgary and Edmonton who choose OpenBSD for its 
stability and proactive security audit. He also gives some project history.<p>

Jethro reports on the mailing lists that MSNBC aired a segment about a small
town in Kentucky with high-speed Internet connectivity. During an interview
with the 
town's teenage security guru, you could read the prompt on his terminal:

Nice high profile mention of OpenBSD by Will Rodger: 
"Yet backers say the speed and transparency with which open source 
programmers compete to discover and then fix problems separates their
operations from traditional software shops. OpenBSD -- still another
open source operating system -- is often called the most secure 
operating system in the world."<p>

Technology writer Simson L. Garfinkel confesses he prefers the BSDs better
than Linux and explains why. He writes a nice paragraph or two about OpenBSD 
and its security and cryptography goals. However, reading this, you'd think 
all the developers were Canadian (hint: they're not).<p>

how to keep *BSD systems up-to-date with CVS. The author takes most of the 
examples from FreeBSD, but he takes the time to explain differences 
between the three systems.  (Most of this is technology was originally

handling flat-out 100Mbit ethernet monitoring, running on OpenBSD, BSDI,
Linux, and Solaris.  OpenBSD comes out as a clear winner just for raw
performance; even before you consider the superior security of OpenBSD
which you probably would want for a network-monitoring station.

adding in some scripts to automate the setup of new projects won management
