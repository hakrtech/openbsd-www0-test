<h3>Ongoing Projects</h3>

<p>
There are many people working on specific projects for OpenBSD, some of which
we cannot mention here yet. Here are some that we can...
<ul>
<li><strong>Cross compilation</strong><br>
       Building a complete system on a different architecture.
<li><strong>PCMCIA support</strong><br>
       Initially for the i386 port (in the tree already).
<li><strong>More ports</strong><br>
       Many more ports... :)
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Projects looking for a home (Help wanted)</h3>

<p>
There are various ways in which people who have time to spare can help
the OpenBSD project. Some require technical knowledge, while others do not:

<ul>
<li><strong>Tracking NetBSD commits</strong><br>
       OpenBSD was originally derived from NetBSD, and still tracks the
       changes &amp; improvements made to NetBSD. If you have the time to
       assist in such work please get in touch with Niklas Hallqvist
       <a href=mailto:niklas@openbsd.org>&lt;niklas@openbsd.org&gt;</a>
<li><strong>Sparc esp driver</strong><br>
       The sparc esp scsi driver has two known problems - on some systems
       with a floppy drive the scsi probe will hang unless there is a disk
       in the drive, and more seriously multiple scsi targets do not
       currently work. The current driver was written by Theo de Raadt
       <a href=mailto:deraadt@theos.com>&lt;deraadt@theos.com&gt;</a>,
       (now back from vacation :).
<li><strong>Documentation</strong><br>
       Enough said - everyone is always looking for people to help on
       documentation!
</ul>
</p>
