<h2><font color=#e00000>Mailing Lists</font><hr></h2>

Mailing lists are an important means of communication among users and developers
of OpenBSD. With the exception of <i>announce</i>, the lists are not moderated.
We deliberately restrict the number of different mailing lists. This helps reduce the 
amount of cross-posting and makes sure that the information gets distributed to a
wide audience.
<p>
<h3><font color=#e00000>Netiquette</font></h3>
<p>
Be considerate of other subscribers on the mailing lists.
<dl>
<dt><u>Plain text, 72 characters per line</u>
<dd>Many subscribers read their mail on text-based mailers (mail(1), emacs)
and they find HTML-formatted messages, or lines that stretch beyond 72
characters often unreadable.
Most OpenBSD mailing lists strip messages of MIME content before
sending them out to the rest of the list.
If you don't use plain text your messages will be reformatted or,
if they cannot be reformatted, summarily rejected.
The only mailing list that allows attachments is the <em>ports</em> list,
they will be removed from messages on the other mailing lists.
<dt><u>Do your homework before you post</u>
<dd>If you have an installation question, make sure that you have read the relevant
documents such as the INSTALL.* text files in the FTP installation directories, the 
<a href=faq/index.html>FAQ</a> and the relevant man pages (start with <a href=
"http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=afterboot&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=OpenBSD+Current&format=html">
afterboot(8)</a>). Make sure you include relevant 
details (version, hardware, <a href=
"http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dmesg&apropos=0&sektion=8&manpath=OpenBSD+Current&format=html"
>dmesg(8)</a>) that will help in troubleshooting. We want to 
help, but we wouldn't want to deprive you of a valuable learning experience.
<dt><u>Include a useful Subject line</u>
<dd>Messages with an empty Subject will get bounced to the list manager and
so will take longer to show up.  Including a relevant Subject in the message
will ensure that more people actually read what you've written.
Also, avoid Subject lines with excessive capitalization.
<dt><u>Trim your signature</u>
<dd>Keep the signature lines at the bottom of your mail to a reasonable length. Posts
are rarely critical enough to warrant a PGP signature, and those automatic address 
cards are merely annoying.
<dt><u>Stay on topic</u>
<dd>Please keep the subject of the post relevant to users of OpenBSD.
</dl>

<p>
<h3><font color=#e00000>Spam</font></h3>
<p>
Spam is always forbidden but sometimes things slip through the
cracks.  If you get spam through one of the OpenBSD mailing lists,
you might want to submit it to <a href="http://spamcop.net">spamcop</a>.
In general, you don't have to send a copy to the list owner--chances
are he's already seen it.  Please note that complaining about
spam on the list proper is counter-productive as it generates more
traffic than the spam itself...
<br>
The OpenBSD mailing lists will deny mail from any host on the
<a href="http://www.mail-abuse.org/rbl/">MAPS RBL</a>,
<a href="http://www.mail-abuse.org/dul/">MAPS Dialup</a> or
<a href="http://www.mail-abuse.org/rss/">MAPS RSS</a> blacklists.
In addition, the list server also has regex-based rules to reject
based on some common spam telltales.

<h3><font color=#e00000>The Mailing Lists</font></h3>
<p>
To subscribe to a given list, send mail to
<a href=mailto:majordomo@OpenBSD.org>majordomo@OpenBSD.org</a>
with a message body of &quot;<strong>subscribe mailing-list-name</strong>&quot;.
<dl>
<dt><strong>announce</strong>
<dd>Important announcements.  This low volume list 
is excellent for people who just want occasional news about the project.
<dt><strong>security-announce</strong>
<dd>Security announcements.  This low volume list receives OpenBSD
security advisories and pointers to security patches as they become
available.
<dt><strong>misc</strong>
<dd>User questions and answers, general questions. This is the most active list.  
Please <a href="faq/index.html">read the FAQ</a> and the installation documents
before you post.
<dt><strong>tech</strong>
<dd>Technical topics for OpenBSD developers and advanced users. 
<strong>Please</strong> direct 'new user' and installation-related questions 
to <em>misc</em>. <strong>Please do not</strong> cross-post to both 
<em>misc</em> and <em>tech</em>.
<dt><strong>bugs</strong>
<dd><a href="report.html">Bug reports</a> as sent in via <a href=
"http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sendbug&apropos=0&sektion=1&manpath=OpenBSD+Current&format=html"
>sendbug(1)</a> and follow-up discussions.

<dd>Automated mailout of CVS source tree changes.
<dt><strong>ports</strong>
<dd>Discussions about using and contributing to the 'ports' source tree.

<dd>Automated mailout of ports-specific CVS source tree changes.
<dt><strong>ipv6</strong>
<dd>Discussions about OpenBSD IP version 6.
<dt><strong>advocacy</strong>
<dd>Promoting the use of OpenBSD. Non-technical discussions in 
<em>misc</em> often get shunted here.
<dt><strong>smp</strong>
<dd>Discussion of Symmetric Multi-Processing design and implementation
on OpenBSD.
</dl>

<p>
OpenBSD also maintains several lists specific to given architectures and special 
projects. These lists are public in the sense that anyone can subscribe to them, but
they should be considered reserved for developers and testers. In keeping with 
the openness principle of OpenBSD, there are no private mailing lists.

<p>
For further assistance, send a message body of "<strong>help</strong>"
to <a href=mailto:majordomo@OpenBSD.org>majordomo@OpenBSD.org</a>
and you will receive a reply outlining all your options.  Your domain
<strong>MUST</strong> resolve properly or the mail will not go through!
