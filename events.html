<p>
<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-5.html>
Defcon V. July 11-13, 1997. Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.</a></strong><br>
At this conference, the OpenBSD team sold 100 or so 2.1 release CDROMs.
Since this is the primary security conference, many speakers said very
good things about our stance on security...

<p>
<li><strong>HOPE. August 1997. New York, New York, USA.</strong><br>
The terminal room consisted primarily of Decstation running
OpenBSD 2.1.

<p>
<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.hip97.nl>HIP. August 1997. Almere, Netherlands</a>
</strong><br>
Niels held a 
<a href=http://www.physnet.uni-hamburg.de/provos/hip97-tcpip.html>talk</a> 
about the problems of unencrypted TCP/IP connections, offering IPSEC as
possible solution.
<p>
<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/sec98/index.html>
Usenix Security. January 26-29, 1998. San Antonio, Texas, USA</a></strong><br>
At this conference, Theo presented an evening talk which basically turned
into a list of fixed security problems and cautionary tales about subsystems
in which future problems may be encountered.
The terminal room PC's ran OpenBSD 2.2.

<p>
<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/usenix98/index.html>
Usenix Annual Technical Conference.
June 15-19, 1998. New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.</a></strong><br>

At Usenix 1998 there was a strong OpenBSD presence both in the Freenix
and normal tracks.  Theo did a general talk about what the OpenBSD
project offers.  Angelos held a panel about IPSEC (which is quite an
OpenBSD topic since IPSEC development at that time was so much further
ahead in OpenBSD than anywhere else).<p>

The terminal room PC's ran OpenBSD 2.3.  We sold many CDROMs.  The
first style of OpenBSD t-shirt also sold quite well.

<p>
<li><strong><a href=http://www.blackhat.com>
BlackHat Sessions. July 29-30, 1998. Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.</a></strong><br>
Theo de Raadt presented a talk entitled
"Auditing software for security" about the OpenBSD security auditing
team's process and the lessons the team learned.  The talk concentrated
on how our process fixes bugs -- not just holes -- since one never knows
when 5 bugs will act together to become a hole.

<p>
<li><strong><a href=http://www.defcon.org>
Defcon VI. July 31 - Aug 2, 1998. Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.</a></strong><br>
The router to the outside world was an OpenBSD 2.3 box.  It was involved
in a "capture the flag" competition in which an entire room of crackers
attempted to break into it and machines running other operating systems.
The OpenBSD box was not broken into.<p>

Almost 100 CDROMs were sold (we ran out again).  The primates at <a
href=http://www.monkey.org>monkey.org</a> brought the second style of
OpenBSD t-shirt to the conference and sold almost 200 of them.  The
proceeds from the sales were donated to the OpenBSD project.

<p>
<li><strong><a href=http://opensource.oreilly.com/townmeet.html>OSDD. August 21, 1998. San Jose, California, USA.</strong><br>
<img align=right border=0 src=oraonline.gif alt="[ORA Logo]"></a> 
O'Reilly and Associates Open Source Developer Days. 
OpenBSD team members will be on-hand to discuss OpenBSD's role among the
other free software projects available as well as sell CDs and t-shirts.

<p>
<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference>
Reflections/Projections 1998
October 2-4, 1998. Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, USA.</a></strong><br>
Theo de Raadt spoke in a panel about Open/Free software with Eric
Raymond and others.

<p>
<li><strong>
<a href="http://www.nceexpo.com/">
NCEE '98. October 9,10 1998. Auburn, Maine, USA.</a></strong><br>

An extensive after-action report was sent to advocacy@openbsd.org. While
sales of shirts and CDROM's left much to be desired, we did have good
opportunities to further project visibility and highlight it's strengths.

<p>
<li><strong>
<a href="http://www.netman.se/ipdagarna">
IP-dagarna, October 29, 30 1998, Stockholm, Sweden.  (in swedish)
</a></strong><br>
At this conference, entirely devoted to IP, Niklas Hallqvist from the
OpenBSD team held a talk on the IKE (a.k.a ISAKMP/Oakley) key management
protocol and experiences from the implementation of <strong>isakmpd</strong>,
an IKE implementation funded by Ericsson Radio Systems developped primarily
for the OpenBSD IPSEC stack.  Isakmpd will be shipped with OpenBSD after
2.4 is released.
