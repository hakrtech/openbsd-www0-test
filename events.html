<p>
<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.usenix.org/events/sec99/index.html>
Usenix Security.
August 23-26, 1999. Washington, DC, USA.</a></strong><p>
Many OpenBSD people from the east coast showed up and sold CDs and
shirts.  It was pretty clear from discussions that many people were
very aware of OpenBSD, and that OpenBSD was being used in very
significant security roles.

<p>
<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/ana97/index.html>
Usenix Annual Technical Conference.
January 6-10, 1997. Anaheim, California, USA.</a></strong><p>
Theo de Raadt held a BOF ("Birds Of a Feather", ie. a meeting of people
interested in the same thing) about OpenBSD.

<p>
<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-5.html>
Defcon V. July 11-13, 1997. Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.</a></strong><p>
At this conference, the OpenBSD team sold 100 or so 2.1 release CDROMs.
<p>
Since this is the primary security conference, many speakers said very
good things about our stance on security... particularily people like
<a href=http://www.l0pht.com>the L0phT</a>.

<p>
<li><strong>HOPE. August 1997. New York, New York, USA.</strong><p>
The terminal room consisted primarily of Decstation running
OpenBSD 2.1.  Once again, the <a href=http://www.l0pht.com>L0phT</a>
people had very good things to say about our security.

<p>
<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.hip97.nl>HIP. August 1997. Almere, Netherlands</a>
</strong><p>
Niels held a 
<a href=http://www.physnet.uni-hamburg.de/provos/hip97-tcpip.html>talk</a> 
about the problems of unencrypted TCP/IP connections, offering IPSEC as
possible solution.

<p>
<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/sec98/index.html>
Usenix Security. January 26-29, 1998. San Antonio, Texas, USA</a></strong><p>
At this conference, Theo presented an evening talk which basically
turned into a list of fixed security problems and cautionary tales about
subsystems in which future problems may be encountered
(<a href=papers/security98-slides.ps>slides available</a>).
<p>
The terminal room PC's ran OpenBSD 2.2.

<p>
<li><strong>
<a name=usenix-neworleans>
<a href=http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/usenix98/index.html>
Usenix Annual Technical Conference.
June 15-19, 1998. New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.</a></strong><p>
At Usenix 1998 there was a strong OpenBSD presence both in the Freenix
and normal tracks.  Theo did a general talk about what the OpenBSD
project offers.  Angelos held a panel about IPSEC (which is quite an
OpenBSD topic since IPSEC development at that time was so much further
ahead in OpenBSD than anywhere else).
<p>
The terminal room PC's ran OpenBSD 2.3.  We sold many CDROMs.  The
first style of OpenBSD t-shirt also sold quite well.

<p>
<li><strong><a href=http://www.blackhat.com>
BlackHat Sessions. July 29-30, 1998. Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.</a></strong><p>
Theo de Raadt presented a talk entitled
"Auditing software for security" about the OpenBSD security auditing
team's process and the lessons the team learned.  The talk concentrated
on how our process fixes bugs -- not just holes -- since one never knows
when 5 bugs will act together to become a hole.

<p>
<a name=defcon98>
<li><strong><a href=http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-6.html>
Defcon VI. July 31 - Aug 2, 1998. Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.</a></strong><p>
The router to the outside world was an OpenBSD 2.3 box.  It was involved
in a "capture the flag" competition in which an entire room of crackers
attempted to break into it and machines running other operating systems.
The OpenBSD box was not broken into.
<p>
Almost 100 OpenBSD 2.3 CDROMs were sold (we ran out again).  The primates
at <a href=http://www.monkey.org>monkey.org</a> brought 2.3 "wire-frame"
OpenBSD t-shirts to the conference and sold almost 200 of them.  The
proceeds from the sales were donated to the OpenBSD project.

<p>
<li><strong><a href=http://opensource.oreilly.com/townmeet.html>O'Reilly and Associates Open Source Developer Days. August 21, 1998. San Jose, California, USA.</strong>
<img align=right border=0 src=images/oraonline.gif alt="[ORA Logo]"></a><p>
OpenBSD team members will be on-hand to discuss OpenBSD's role among the
other free software projects available as well as sell CDs and t-shirts.

<p>
<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference>
Reflections/Projections 1998
October 2-4, 1998. Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, USA.</a></strong><p>
Theo de Raadt spoke in a panel about Open/Free software with Eric
Raymond and others.

<p>
<li><strong>
<a href="http://www.nceexpo.com/">
NCEE '98. October 9,10 1998. Auburn, Maine, USA.</a></strong><p>
An extensive after-action report was sent to advocacy@openbsd.org. While
sales of shirts and CDROM's left much to be desired, we did have good
opportunities to further project visibility and highlight its strengths.

<p>
<li><strong>
<a href="http://www.netman.se/ipdagarna">
IP-dagarna, October 29, 30 1998, Stockholm, Sweden.  (in swedish)
</a></strong><p>
At this conference, entirely devoted to IP, Niklas Hallqvist from the
OpenBSD team held a talk on the IKE (a.k.a ISAKMP/Oakley) key management
protocol and experiences from the implementation of <strong>isakmpd</strong>,
an IKE implementation funded by Ericsson Radio Systems and developed
primarily for the OpenBSD IPSEC stack.
<p>
Isakmpd will be shipped with OpenBSD after 2.4 is released.

<p>
<li><strong>
<a href="http://www.asc.unam.mx/disc98">
DISC - Seguridad en C'omputo 98:
November 2-7, 1998. Mexico City.</a></strong><p>
Theo de Raadt gave a talk about security auditing, sponsored by
<a href=http://www.core-sdi.com>CORE SDI S.A.</a>, an Argentinian
security auditing company who strongly believes in the future
of OpenBSD. (<a href=papers/mexico98-slides.ps>Slides are available</a>).

<p>
<li><strong>
<a name=lisaboston-98>
<a href=http://usenix.org/events/lisa98>
LISA '98: 12th Systems Administration Conference
December 6-11, 1998. Boston, Massachusetts.</a></strong><p>
More than 10 OpenBSD team members showed up.  By far, OpenBSD was the
largest representative group from free software at the conference.
<p>
Usenix donated us a table in the vendor area where we sold 2.4 CDROMs,
2.3 "wire-frame" t-shirts, and the new 2.4 embroidered
"Because security matters..." t-shirts, polos, and sweaters.
<p>
An OpenBSD BOF was held one evening, led by Theo de Raadt.
<p>
The terminal room ran OpenBSD 2.4 on 45 machines.  Obviously people's
trust in OpenBSD has increased, since numerous people who have not
used the Usenix terminal room (due to security problems that have come
from such use in the past) before were seen using the machines.
<p>
A PalmPilot schedule loader was at the membership booth, powered by OpenBSD.

<p>
<li><strong><a name=ipsec98></a>
<a href=http://www.netman.se/kurs/96.html>
IPsec/VPN Interoperability tests & seminar
December 14, 1998. Stockholm, Sweden.  (in swedish)</a></strong><br>
OpenBSD was represented as one of about a dozen
<a href=http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ipsec&sektion=4&format=html>IPsec</a>
implementations who were tested for interoperability.  The tests were
successful, both for the technology in general, and for OpenBSD in
specific.  We managed to communicate encrypted with every vendor present,
and to negotiate keys via IKE with everyone capable.

<p>
<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.europen.se/NordU99>
NordU99 -- The first EurOpen/USENIX Conference.
February 9-12, 1999. Stockholm, Sweden.</a></strong><p>
A couple of OpenBSD team members were there and some of the swedish user
society as well.  OpenBSD CDs were sold at a booth and at the end of a
security talk, the project got applauded for its continuous strive of auditing
security sensitive parts of the system.

<p>
<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.ietf.org/meetings/IETF-44.html>
44th IETF meeting.
March 15-19, 1999. Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA</a></strong><p>
Some OpenBSD team members were at this conference, in particular our
IPSEC developers.

<p>
<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.linuxexpo.org>
5th Annual Linux Expo.
May 18-22, 1999. Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.</a></strong><p>
Some OpenBSD team members were at this conference selling OpenBSD 2.5 CDs,
OpenBSE T-shirts, as well as Blowfish T-shirts, which sold out very quickly
at a table donated by the Expo.  OpenBSD was the only BSD represented at the
vendor exposition, and we had good chance to present a secure alternative
to Linux.

<p>
<a name=usenix99>
<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix99/index.html>
Usenix Annual Technical Conference.
June 6-11, 1999. Monterey, California, USA.</a></strong><p>
OpenBSD team members will surely be at this conference.
Some OpenBSD developers are presenting papers in the Freenix track.<p>
The <a href="http://www.usenix.org">USENIX Association</a> recently
provided The OpenBSD Project with a grant to underwrite the production
of CDs of its newest release, OpenBSD 2.5.  (We will be distributing the
new release for free to attendees of the USENIX Annual Conference in
June.)
<p>
Usenix team members were involved in the authoring and
presentation of 4 OpenBSD-related papers:`
<p>
