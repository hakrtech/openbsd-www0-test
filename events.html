IPsec Interoperability tests September 27-30, 1999. Stockholm, Sweden.
(in swedish)</strong><br>
A dozen vendors, among them OpenBSD, tested more than 15 
<a href=http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ipsec&sektion=4&format=html>IPsec</a>
products, both gateways and hosts, for interoperability.  The tests
were successful as far as general IPsec and pre-shared key
authentication went, OpenBSD interoperated with everyone, but due to
time constraints we never got to test the certificate support
appropriately.  The results were presented later that fall at a
conference in Stockholm.

Usenix Security.
August 23-26, 1999. Washington, DC, USA.</a></strong><br>
Many OpenBSD people from the east coast showed up and sold CDs and
shirts.  It was pretty clear from discussions that many people were
very aware of OpenBSD, and that OpenBSD was being used in very
significant security roles.
<p>

July 12-16, 1999. Oslo, Norway</a></strong><br>
A number of OpenBSD team members from all over the world were at this
conference. In addition to attending the IPsec and DNS working groups (among
others) we did IPsec/IKE interoperability testing together with
the Japanese KAME project. Also, Angelos D. Keromytis did a presentation on
his work with keynote and isakmpd in OpenBSD.

5th Annual Linux Expo.
May 18-22, 1999. Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.</a></strong><br>
Some OpenBSD team members were at this conference selling OpenBSD 2.5 CDs,
OpenBSE T-shirts, as well as Blowfish T-shirts, which sold out very quickly
at a table donated by the Expo.  OpenBSD was the only BSD represented at the
vendor exposition, and we had good chance to present a secure alternative
to Linux.
<p>

<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/99mar/index.html>
44th IETF meeting.
March 15-19, 1999. Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA</a></strong><br>

<li><strong>
<a href="http://www.europen.se/NordU99">NordU99 -- The first EurOpen/USENIX Conference.
February 9-12, 1999. Stockholm, Sweden.</a></strong><br>
A couple of OpenBSD team members were there and some of the swedish user
society as well.  OpenBSD CDs were sold at a booth and at the end of a
security talk, the project got applauded for its continuous strive of auditing
security sensitive parts of the system.
<p>

<h3>1998</h3>

<li><strong><a name=ipsec98></a>
<a href=http://www.netman.se/kurs/96.html>IPsec/VPN Interoperability
tests &amp; seminar, December 14, 1998.
Stockholm, Sweden. (in swedish)</a></strong><br>
OpenBSD was represented as one of about a dozen
<a href=http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ipsec&sektion=4&format=html>IPsec</a>
implementations who were tested for interoperability.  The tests were
successful, both for the technology in general, and for OpenBSD in
specific.  We managed to communicate encrypted with every vendor present,
and to negotiate keys via IKE with everyone capable.
<p>

<li><strong>
<a name=lisaboston-98>
<a href=http://usenix.org/events/lisa98>LISA '98:
12th Systems Administration Conference
December 6-11, 1998. Boston, Massachusetts.</a></strong><br>
More than 10 OpenBSD team members showed up.  By far, OpenBSD was the
largest representative group from free software at the conference.
Usenix gave us a table in the vendor area where we sold 2.4 CDROMs,
2.3 "wire-frame" t-shirts, and the new 2.4 embroidered
"Because security matters..." t-shirts, polos, and sweaters.
An OpenBSD BOF was held one evening, led by Theo de Raadt.
A PalmPilot schedule loader was at the membership booth, powered by OpenBSD.
<br>
The terminal room ran OpenBSD 2.4 on 45 machines. Obviously  trust in OpenBSD
had increased since many people,normally wary of security problems of open
terminal rooms, were seen using the machines.

<a href=http://www.core-sdi.com>CORE SDI S.A.</a>, an Argentinian
security auditing company who strongly believes in the future
of OpenBSD. (<a href=papers/mexico98-slides.ps>Slides are available</a>).
<p>

<li><strong>
IP-dagarna, October 29, 30 1998, Stockholm, Sweden.  (in swedish)
</strong><br>
At this conference, entirely devoted to IP, Niklas Hallqvist from the
OpenBSD team held a talk on the IKE (a.k.a ISAKMP/Oakley) key management
protocol and experiences from the implementation of <strong>isakmpd</strong>,
an IKE implementation funded by Ericsson Radio Systems and developed
primarily for the OpenBSD IPSEC stack.
<p>

<li><strong>
<a href="http://www.nceexpo.com/">NCEE '98.
October 9,10 1998. Auburn, Maine, USA.</a></strong><br>
An extensive after-action report was sent to advocacy@openbsd.org. While
sales of shirts and CDROMs left much to be desired, we did have good
opportunities to further project visibility and highlight its strengths.
<p>

<li><strong><a href=http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-6.html>Defcon VI.
July 31 - Aug 2, 1998. Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.</a></strong><br>
The router to the outside world was an OpenBSD 2.3 box.  It was involved
in a "capture the flag" competition in which an entire room of crackers
attempted to break into it and machines running other operating systems.
The OpenBSD box was not broken into.
<br>
Almost 100 OpenBSD 2.3 CDROMs were sold (we ran out again).  The primates
at <a href=http://www.monkey.org>monkey.org</a> brought 2.3
&quot;wire-frame&quot; OpenBSD t-shirts to the conference and sold almost
200 of them.  The proceeds from the sales were donated to the OpenBSD project.
<p>

<li><strong><a href=http://www.blackhat.com>
BlackHat Sessions. July 29-30, 1998. Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.</a></strong><br>
Theo de Raadt presented a talk entitled
"Auditing software for security" about the OpenBSD security auditing
team's process and the lessons the team learned.  The talk concentrated
on how our process fixes bugs -- not just holes -- since one never knows
when 5 bugs will act together to become a hole.

Usenix Annual Technical Conference.
June 15-19, 1998. New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.</a></strong><br>
At Usenix 1998 there was a strong OpenBSD presence both in the Freenix
and normal tracks.  Theo did a general talk about what the OpenBSD
project offers.  Angelos held a panel about IPSEC (which is quite an
OpenBSD topic since IPSEC development at that time was so much further
ahead in OpenBSD than anywhere else).
<br>
The terminal room PCs ran OpenBSD 2.3.  We sold many CDROMs.  The
first style of OpenBSD t-shirt also sold quite well.
<p>

<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/sec98/index.html>
Usenix Security. January 26-29, 1998. San Antonio, Texas, USA</a></strong><br>
At this conference, Theo presented an evening talk which basically
turned into a list of fixed security problems and cautionary tales about
subsystems in which future problems may be encountered
(<a href=papers/security98-slides.ps>slides available</a>).
<br>
The terminal room PCs ran OpenBSD 2.2.
<p>

<h3>1997</h3>

<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.hip97.nl>HIP. August 1997. Almere, Netherlands</a>
</strong><br>
Niels held a 
<a href=http://www.physnet.uni-hamburg.de/provos/hip97-tcpip.html>talk</a> 
about the problems of unencrypted TCP/IP connections, offering IPSEC as
possible solution.
<p>

<li><strong>HOPE. August 1997. New York, New York, USA.</strong><br>
The terminal room consisted primarily of DECstations running
OpenBSD 2.1.  Once again, the <a href=http://www.l0pht.com>L0phT</a>
people had very good things to say about our security.
<p>

<li><strong><a name=defcon5></a>
<a href=http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-5.html>
Defcon V. July 11-13, 1997. Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.</a></strong><br>
At this conference, the OpenBSD team sold 100 or so 2.1 release CDROMs.
<br>
Since this is the primary security conference, many speakers said very
good things about our stance on security... particularly people like
<a href=http://www.l0pht.com>the L0phT</a>.
<p>

<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/ana97/index.html>
Usenix Annual Technical Conference.
January 6-10, 1997. Anaheim, California, USA.</a></strong><br>
