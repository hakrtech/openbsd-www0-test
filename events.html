<h2>Past events:</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>

January 6-10, 1997. Anaheim, California, USA.</a></strong><br>

<p>
<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-5.html>
Defcon V. July 11-13, 1997. Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.</a></strong><br>
At this conference, the OpenBSD team sold 100 or so 2.1 release CDROMs.
Since this is the primary security conference, many speakers said very
good things about our stance on security...

<p>
<li><strong>HOPE. August 1997. New York, New York, USA.</strong><br>
The terminal room consisted primarily of Decstation running
OpenBSD 2.1.

<p>
<li><strong>HIP. August 1997. Almere, Netherlands</strong><br>

<p>
<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/sec98/index.html>
Usenix Security. January 26-29, 1998. San Antonio</a></strong><br>
At this conference, Theo presented an evening talk which basically turned
into a list of fixed security problems and cautionary tales about subsystems
in which future problems may be encountered.
The terminal room PC's ran OpenBSD 2.2.

<p>
<li><strong>
<a href=http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/usenix98/index.html>
Usenix Annual Technical Conference.
June 15-19, 1998. New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.</a></strong><br>
At Usenix 1998 there was a strong OpenBSD presence both in the Freenix
and normal tracks.  The terminal room PC's ran OpenBSD 2.3.<p>

We sold many CDROMs.  The first style of OpenBSD t-shirt also sold quite well.

<p>
<li><strong><a href=http://www.blackhat.com>
BlackHat Sessions. July 29-30, 1998. Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.</a></strong><br>
Theo de Raadt presented a talk entitled
"Auditing software for security" about the OpenBSD security auditing
team's process and the lessons the team learned.  The talk concentrated
on how our process fixes bugs -- not just holes -- since one never knows
when 5 bugs will act together to become a hole.

<p>
<li><strong><a href=http://www.defcon.org>
Defcon VI. July 31 - Aug 2, 1998. Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.</a></strong><br>
The router to the outside world was an OpenBSD 2.3 box.  It was involved
in a "capture the flag" competition in which an entire room of crackers
attempted to break into it and machines running other operating systems.
The OpenBSD box was not broken into.<p>

Almost 100 CDROMs were sold (we ran out again).  The primates at <a
href=http://www.monkey.org>monkey.org</a> brought the second style of
OpenBSD t-shirt to the conference and sold almost 200 of them.  The
proceeds from the sales were donated to the OpenBSD project.

<p>
