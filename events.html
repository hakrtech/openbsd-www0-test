Conference attendees had the opportunity to test drive the new release,
OpenBSD 2.7, on the 30 workstations in the terminal room.  For the first
time ever, the terminal room and wavelan networks also had a IPv6 connection,
and some users even discovered so by themselves.
Theo also held a BoF on the Wednesday evening, after which the developers
had almost too much singing in foreign languages with the help of helium.

products, both gateways and hosts, for interoperability.  The tests
were successful as far as general IPsec and pre-shared key
authentication went, OpenBSD interoperated with everyone, but due to
time constraints we never got to test the certificate support
appropriately.  The results were presented later that fall at a

largest representative group from free software at the conference.
Usenix gave us a table in the vendor area where we sold 2.4 CDROMs,
2.3 "wire-frame" t-shirts, and the new 2.4 embroidered
"Because security matters..." t-shirts, polos, and sweaters.
An OpenBSD BOF was held one evening, led by Theo de Raadt.
A PalmPilot schedule loader was at the membership booth, powered by OpenBSD.
<br>
The terminal room ran OpenBSD 2.4 on 45 machines. Obviously  trust in OpenBSD
had increased since many people,normally wary of security problems of open
terminal rooms, were seen using the machines.

in a "capture the flag" competition in which an entire room of crackers
attempted to break into it and machines running other operating systems.
The OpenBSD box was not broken into.
<br>
Almost 100 OpenBSD 2.3 CDROMs were sold (we ran out again).  The primates

<a href="http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/usenix98/index.html">Usenix Annual Technical Conference</a></strong>,
Jun 15 - 19, 1998, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA<br>
At Usenix 1998 there was a strong OpenBSD presence both in the Freenix
and normal tracks.  Theo did a general talk about what the OpenBSD
project offers.  Angelos held a panel about IPSEC (which is quite an
OpenBSD topic since IPSEC development at that time was so much further
ahead in OpenBSD than anywhere else).
<br>
The terminal room PCs ran OpenBSD 2.3.  We sold many CDROMs.  The
first style of OpenBSD t-shirt also sold quite well.

<a href="http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/sec98/index.html">Usenix Security</a></strong>,
Jan 26 - 29, 1998, San Antonio, Texas, USA<br>
At this conference, Theo presented an evening talk which basically
turned into a list of fixed security problems and cautionary tales about
subsystems in which future problems may be encountered
(<a href="papers/security98-slides.ps">slides available</a>).
<br>
The terminal room PCs ran OpenBSD 2.2.

about the problems of unencrypted TCP/IP connections, offering IPSEC as
possible solution.

<li><strong>HOPE</strong>,
Aug, 1997, New York, New York, USA<br>
The terminal room consisted primarily of DECstations running
OpenBSD 2.1.  Once again, the <a href="http://www.l0pht.com">L0phT</a>
people had very good things to say about our security.

Jul 11 - 13, 1997, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA<br>
At this conference, the OpenBSD team sold 100 or so 2.1 release CDROMs.
<br>
Since this is the primary security conference, many speakers said very
good things about our stance on security... particularly people like
<a href="http://www.l0pht.com">the L0phT</a>.
