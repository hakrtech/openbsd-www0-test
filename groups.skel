<H1>OpenBSD User Groups</H1>
<IMG SRC="images/groups.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P>The continuing growth of OpenBSD depends on attracting new
users, developers, software suppliers, 
and consultants. One means of reaching new users is via users groups,
where people can exchange experiences, ideas, free software, and find
out that there are others with similar problems and solutions.
<P>The following user groups are either specific to OpenBSD or
at least to the BSD family of systems.
However, the OpenBSD Project does not necessarily endorse any of these.
Please contact the User's Group directly.
</P>
<P>These entries are arranged geographically, so that you may more readily find
a users' group near you.
<P>If you want to see your group listed here, please email ian at openbsd.org
with a filled-in version of
<A HREF="groups-template.txt">groups-template.txt</A>
telling me the name, email and/or URL, location, 
and whether it is an OpenBSD group or a *BSD group.</P>
