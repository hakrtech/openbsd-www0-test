<h2><font color=#e00000><strong>Products for OpenBSD<hr></strong></font></h2>

<p>
Various commercial products for OpenBSD are available from the following
companies:<p>

<dl>
<li><font color=#e00000><strong>NFR</strong></font><br>
<a href="http://www.nfr.net/">NFR</a> uses OpenBSD as their primary development
platform for their Network Flight Recorder intrusion detection software.
The NFR package is available as stand-alone software for OpenBSD, or as an
embedded product called the <a href=http://www.nfr.net/products/ida-facts.html>
NFR Intrusion Detection Appliance</a>, which happens to run OpenBSD internally
(unfortunately, we believe it to be OpenBSD 2.3).
On their web page, NFR doesn't tell their customers that the operating
system inside the IDA is OpenBSD.

<li><font color=#e00000><strong>Anzen Computing</strong></font><br>
<a href="http://www.anzen.com/">Anzen Computing</a> sells
<a href="http://www.anzen.com/afj/">Anzen Flight Jacket</a>,
a more comprehensive intrustion detection system based on NFR.
Independently, they also chose OpenBSD as their
<a href="http://www.anzen.com/afj/afj_packaged.html">primary packaged system</a>.
As well, <a href=press.html#anzen1>a technical paper from Anzen</a> reports
that out of a number of major operating systems, OpenBSD is the fastest
platform for running NFR.<p>

<li><font color=#e00000><strong>Covalent's Raven SSL</strong></font><br>
<a href="http://www.covalent.net">Covalent Technologies Inc.</a> provides
RSA licensed 128-bit strong cryptography to the widely acclaimed Apache Web
Server on OpenBSD with their award winning
<a href="http://www.ravenssl.com">Raven SSL Module</a>.  (OpenBSD contains
SSL capable httpd, but use of it in the USA requires a licence from RSA,
which Raven does for you.  It also includes support and easy tools for
assisting new https admins).
