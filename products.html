<p>
Various commercial products for OpenBSD are available from the following
companies:
<p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Open Sound System</strong><br>
(i386 only)<br>
A substantially spiffed-up commercial version of the OpenBSD audio
device drivers is available from
<a href=http://www.opensound.com/>http://www.opensound.com/</a>.
These replacement drivers are compatible with the audio drivers
OpenBSD ships with, but they support many additional cards and take
full advantage of these cards' features.
<p>
<li><strong>RTMX</strong><br>
<a href=http://www.rtmx.com>RTMX</a> sells a version of OpenBSD
which has a full compliment of POSIX realtime features added to it.
</ul>
