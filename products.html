<h2><font color=#e00000><strong>Products for OpenBSD<hr></strong></font></h2>

<p>
OpenBSD encourages companies and independent developers to create products
for use with OpenBSD, or based on OpenBSD itself.
<p>
Commercial support for OpenBSD is available from vendors listed on 
<a href=support.html>our support page</a>.<p>

<li><font color=#e00000><strong>ePipe by Stallion Technologies
</strong></font><br>
<a href="http://www.stallion.com/html/solutions/internet-vpn.html">Stallion 
Technologies</a> uses <a 
href="http://www.stallion.com/html/corporate/epipe-openbsd-pr.html">OpenBSD
as an embedded operating system</a> in its ePipe dial-up network gateway
for small and medium businesses. The gateway box is intended to beat the
high cost of <a 
href="http://www.stallion.com/html/products/epipe-white-papers.html">the
last mile</a> for small business VPNs and
<a href="http://www.stallion.com/html/corporate/asp-release.html">application
service providers</a> delivering hosted applications to small businesses.
ePipe runs on a Motorola ColdFire 5307 VL-RISC processor and uses OpenBSD's
built-in encryption software to deliver secure end to end connections.

<li><font color=#e00000><strong>NFR</strong></font><br>
<a href="http://www.nfr.net/">NFR</a> uses OpenBSD as their primary development
platform for their Network Flight Recorder intrusion detection software.
The NFR package is available as stand-alone software for OpenBSD, or as an
embedded product called the <a href=http://www.nfr.net/products/ida-facts.html>
NFR Intrusion Detection Appliance</a>, which happens to run OpenBSD internally.
On their web page, NFR doesn't tell their customers that the operating
system inside the IDA is OpenBSD.
<p>

<li><font color=#e00000><strong>Anzen Computing</strong></font><br>
<a href="http://www.anzen.com/">Anzen Computing</a> sells
<a href="http://www.anzen.com/afj/">Anzen Flight Jacket</a>,
a more comprehensive intrustion detection system based on NFR.
Independently, they also chose OpenBSD as their
<a href="http://www.anzen.com/afj/afj_packaged.html">primary packaged system</a>.
As well, <a href=press.html#anzen1>a technical paper from Anzen</a> reports
that out of a number of major operating systems, OpenBSD is the fastest
platform for running NFR.<p>
<p>

<li><font color=#e00000><strong>Hiverworld</strong></font><br>
<a href="http://www.hiverworld.com">Hiverworld</a> provides continuous
vulnerability assessment in an appliance that runs OpenBSD and they
are working on a 100Mbit and Gigabit IDS (using OpenBSD) that will be
released later this year.
<p>

<li><font color=#e00000><strong>Network Security Wizards</strong></font><br>
<a href="http://www.securitywizards.com">Network Security Wizards</a> 
produces the Dragon IDS for the OpenBSD platform.
Dragon is a packet based intrusion detection system which can operate with
1200 signatures. The signatures identify all phases of network misuse
including probes, attacks and actual compromises. Dragon operates on
fully saturated 100 Mb/s networks and many Dragon customers operate in the
200 Mb/s range on Gigabit Ethernet segments.  NSW also sells 2U boxes
running OpenBSD + Dragon, for people who wish to just plug & play.
<p>

<li><font color=#e00000><strong>RTMX</strong></font><br>
<a href=http://www.rtmx.com>RTMX</a> sells a version of OpenBSD
which has a full complement of POSIX realtime features added to it.
They have graciously donated the source code for these extensions, and
these changes will be integrated into OpenBSD soon.
