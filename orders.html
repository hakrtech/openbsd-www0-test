The OpenBSD 2.1 release is available on two CDROMs in a thin jewel
case for
<strong>$30 USD + postage (and any required taxes if you live
in Canada)</strong>.
The package includes:
<ul>
<li>A full source tree (ready for AnonCVS use).
<li>The complete install components for 8 architectures.
<li>X11R6.3 and XFree86 3.3 for many architectures.
<li>X11R6.3 and XFree86 3.3 source code
<li>The FreeBSD ports tree.
<li>CTM bases for tracking CTM afterwards.  This includes a CTM
	base of the entire OpenBSD CVS repository.
<li>The CD's are bootable on i386, sparc, and arc.
<li>Supports alpha, amiga, arc, i386, mac68k, mvme68k, pmax, and sparc.
<li>And many other things.
</ul>

Postage will vary depending on your location relative to the shipping
address.  Regular post will be used unless special arrangements are
made.  Shipping cost is therefore expected to be around $3 - $8 USD
(yes, that is in addition to the base $30 USD price).  Packages will
be mailed from the following locations, depending on destination:
<ul>
<li>Calgary, Alberta, Canada
<li>Stockholm, Sweden
<li>Buenos Aires, Argentina
</ul>

<strong>
NOTE:<br>
The people who are selling the OpenBSD CDROMs for the
OpenBSD project know next to nothing about OpenBSD.  They cannot help
with technical problems at all.  If you need help or advice, you
should be using newsgroups, mailing lists, web pages, IRC, and other
resources to get your questions answered.
</strong>
<p>

The CDROMs will not be shipped until June 23.  There is an
