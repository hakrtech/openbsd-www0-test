<h2>The OpenBSD <strong>2.2</strong> release is available on two
CDROMs for <strong>$30 USD + postage</strong><br>
(plus any required taxes if you live in Canada).<p>
</h2>

<h3>
The 2.2 CDROMs will not be shipped until Dec 1, '97.<p>
There is an <a href=errata.html>Errata List</a>.
</h3>

The package includes:
<ul>
<li>The complete install components for <strong>NINE</strong>
    architectures.  This is a complete list of architectures:
	<ul>
	<li><strong>alpha</strong>
	<li><strong>amiga</strong>
	<li><strong>arc</strong>
	<li><strong>hp300</strong>
	<li><strong>i386</strong>
	<li><strong>mac68k</strong>
	<li><strong>mvme68k</strong>
	<li><strong>pmax</strong>
	<li><strong>sparc</strong>.
	</ul>
<li><strong>The CD's are bootable on i386, sparc, alpha, and arc.</strong>
<li>A funky CD insert sheet which contains <strong>much</strong> better installation
	instructions than OpenBSD 2.1 shipped with.
<li>A full source tree (ready for <a href=anoncvs.html>AnonCVS</a> use).
<li>The latest <strong>XFree86</strong> binaries for most of the architectures
	(all except mvme68k)
<li>The latest <strong>XFree86</strong> source code.
<li>Our own little <a href=ports.html>ports tree</a> (much like the FreeBSD
	ports tree, but smaller).
<li>CTM bases for tracking <a href=ctm.html>CTM</a> afterwards.  This includes
	a CTM base of the entire OpenBSD CVS repository.
<li><strong>2 OpenBSD Stickers included!</strong>
<li>And many other things...
</ul>

<p>
<strong>
NOTE:<br>
Most of the people who are selling the OpenBSD CDROMs for the
OpenBSD project know next to nothing about OpenBSD.  They cannot help
with technical problems at all.  If you need help or advice, you
should be using newsgroups (comp.unix.bsd.openbsd.misc),
<a href=mail.html>mailing lists</a>,
<a href=index.html>our web pages</a>,
IRC,
and other internet resources to get your questions answered.

<h2>There are a number of ways to order an OpenBSD CDROM.</h2>
<p>

<ul>
<li>
<h3>The Computer Shop of Calgary:</h3>
The main place for ordering CDROMs is the Computer Shop of Calgary (the
oldest continuously operating computer store in the world).

<p>
Postage will vary depending on your location relative to the shipping
address.  Regular post will be used unless special arrangements are
made.  Shipping cost is therefore expected to be around $3 - $8 USD
(yes, that is in addition to the base $30 USD price).  Packages will
be mailed from Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  Typical postage rates for
quantity 1 are roughly:
<ul>
<li>Canada $3 CDN
<li>USA $3 USD ($4 CDN)
<li>World $4 USD ($5 CDN)
</ul>
<p>
If you want your CD to come very quickly, you can choose Fedex.
If you choose Fedex, you very likely do NOT want to use the credit
card ordering system, but want to order your package by phoning the
Computer Shop phone number below.  Typical Fedex rates for quantity
1 are roughly:
<ul>
<li>Canada $12.50 CDN
<li>USA $18 USD ($24.50 CDN)
<li>World $36 USD ($49.50 CDN)
</ul>
(Wow, Fedex is expensive!)
<p>

<h3>There are a few different ways to make an order from
the Computer Shop:</h3>
<ul>
<li><h3>WWW credit card ordering:</h3>
First, we have a
<a href=https://https.openbsd.org/order.html>
SSL secure credit card ordering system</a>.
<br>
A
<a href=http://https.openbsd.org:80/order.html>
non-SSL credit card ordering form</a> also exists.
<p>

<li><h3>Telephone ordering:</h3>
To order by phone, dial <strong>(403) 605-8166</strong>.  Please phone
during weekdays, during the daytime, in North American Mountain Time.
(Partial service is available after hours: 5PM-9PM weeknights and
10AM-9PM weekends.)
Have your Mastercard, VISA, or American Express ready.
<p>
Major Institutions can fax purchase orders to the Computer Shop
at <strong>(403) 243-2684 (FAX)</strong>.
<p>

<li><h3>Mail order:</h3>
Additionally, you can also mail USD or Canadian cheques (in which case
CDN $40, shipping $4 is sufficient) to:<p>
