<h1>OpenBSD porting information</h1>

<h2><font color="#e00000">Important differences from other
BSD</font></h2>

NetBSD uses the term <em>ports</em> for architecture-dependent
issues. Their ports structure is called <em>packages</em> instead. 

<h3>Generic infrastructure issues</h3>

You can test if a specific version of <code>bsd.port.mk</code> is
available by setting NEED_VERSION.

<br><br>

 Always put the NEED_VERSION line right beneath CATEGORIES to
simplify automated processing.

<br><br>

OpenBSD's make supports <code>${VAR:U}</code> and <code>
${VAR:L}</code> to transform a variable's value into uppercase or
lowercase. Accordingly, make tests should be coded in a
case-independent way, e.g., 

<ul><pre>
.if ${NEED_XXX:L} == "yes"
do stuff if yes
.else
do other stuff
.endif
</pre></ul>

<br>
<br>
 There is a move to ensure all variables recognized by <code>
bsd.port.mk</code> are always defined, so that eventually we will
get rid of <code>defined(GNU_CONFIGURE)</code> and use <code>
${GNU_CONFIGURE:L} != "no"</code> instead. 

<br><br>

 The main <code>bsd.port.mk</code> file has been heavily
streamlined and fixed. In particular, it is parallel-make ready.
The <code>scripts/{pre,do,post}-*</code> feature has been lost in
the process. To replace that feature, invoke the script manually
from the Makefile. 

<h3>Using make properly</h3>

Note that, if you invoke make as <code>make VAR=value</code>, the
assignment will <em>override</em> whatever value VAR may get from the
Makefile. So, many Makefile patches are not necessary, it is
much better to set MAKE_FLAGS correctly, to decrease the
maintenance burden. 

<h3>Fetching sources</h3>

There are two kinds of source archives: DISTFILES and PATCHFILES.
OpenBSD processes them in a uniform way, and retrieves everything
from MASTER_SITES by default. There are <strong>no</strong> 
PATCH_SITES nor PATCH_SITES_SUBDIR.

<br><br>

If all files to fetch don't come from the same set of sites,
OpenBSD allows the extension filename:0 to filename:9, in which
case it will use MASTER_SITES0 to MASTER_SITES9 to retrieve the
file.

<br><br>

Some architectures may need specific distfiles. In the past, this
has caused trouble where mirroring distfiles was concerned. OpenBSD
supports a third set of files: SUPDISTFILES. Those will be
considered only for creating checksums and mirroring purposes. Note
that SUPDISTFILES may have an overlap with DISTFILES or PATCHFILES.
For instance, 

<pre>
DISTFILES=foo-1.0.tgz
.if ${ARCH} == "i386"
DISTFILES+=foo-i386.tgz
.elif ${ARCHI} == "sparc"
DISTFILES+=foo-sparc.tgz
.endif
SUPDISTFILES=foo-i386.tgz foo-sparc.tgz
</pre>

<h3>The <code>work</code> infrastructure</h3>

We don't want ports that use <code>NO_WRKDIR</code>. All OpenBSD
ports must have a work directory. Naming details of those work
directories should not be a porter's concerns. If you need to find
out about such a name, ask the Makefile: <code>cd that_ports_dir
&amp;&amp; make show VARNAME=WRKDIR</code> will yield that port's
idea of <code>WRKDIR</code>.

<br><br>

The main reason behind that prohibition is that OpenBSD's <code>
bsd.port.mk</code> acts like a real Makefile, with dependencies.
The <code>fetch</code> stage depends upon the distfiles and
patchfiles, all other stages depend on real files living in the
working directory (cookies), so they can't exist without a working
directory.

<br><br>

Due to historical accident, the <code>do-extract</code> fragment
does create the working directory. Accordingly, <code>
pre-extract</code> and <code>do-extract</code> should <em>
never</em> be overriden. If the DISTFILES extraction is special,
set 
<pre>
EXTRACT_ONLY=
</pre> 
and do the extraction in <code>post-extract.</code>
<dl>
<dt>WRKDIR</dt>

<dd><code>The port working directory, where it puts its own
cookies.</code></dd>

<dt>WRKDIST</dt>

<dd><code>Subdirectory of WRKDIR where the port actually unpacks.
It is also the base directory for patch. Other BSD currently don't
have the WRKDIST/WRKSRC distinction and have only
WRKSRC.</code></dd>

<dt>WRKSRC</dt>

<dd><code>Subdirectory of WRKDIST where the actual source
lives.</code></dd>

<dt>WRKBUILD</dt>

<dd><code>Subdirectory of WRKDIR where the port configure and build
will occur. Other BSD don't have the WRKBUILD/WRKSRC distinction.
Programs based on autoconf (mostly) can usually set SEPARATE_BUILD
to let the port build happen in a WRKBUILD distinct from
WRKSRC.</code></dd>

<dt>WRKINST</dt>

<dd><code>Directory where the port will be installed before being
packaged (see Faking ports below).</code></dd>
</dl>

<em>Note that NO_WRKSUBDIR has been removed: its functionality can be
achieved by setting WRKDIST=$(WRKDIR) instead. </em>
</pre>

<h3><code>Faking ports</code></h3>

<h4><code>Introduction</code></h4>

<code>After a build is complete, other BSDs proceed to install a
port, then build a package from the installed port.
<br>
OpenBSD uses faked installation instead. The ports tree is not
entirely converted to using FAKE, but it is getting there.</code>

<ul>
<li>A faked port is configured and built normally (e.g., to
install under <code>PREFIX</code>, usually <code>
/usr/local</code>).</li>

<li>But it's told to install elsewhere, namely under WRKINST, which
is usually a subdirectory of WRKDIR.</li>

<li>Then the false installation is packaged, using the -s option of
pkg_create.</li>

<li>Finally, the resulting package can be installed, using
pkg_add.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Advantages</h4>

<ul>
<li>For a package builder, it means that most ports don't have to
actually be installed, which removes a large number of potential
compromises and general nastiness from badly installed ports. It
also allows building several conflicting packages on the same
machine. Finally, it allows building a new set of untested packages
without hosing a correct installation.</li>

<li>For a port writer, it greatly simplifies the task of finding
problems in packing lists, since the fake area of installation is
empty before the port gets installed. Also, if a port installs too
many files, it is no longer necessary to tweak the port
installation: it is enough not to record the extraneous files in
the packing list.</li>

<li>For the end user, it improves the quality of packages: since
the final port is installed using pkg_add, the end user gets <em>
exactly</em> the same software that was prepared on the porter's
machine.</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

To activate the fake framework, you just need to set FAKE=Yes in
the port Makefile.

<br><br>

The targets invoked for <code>make fake</code> are the usual
install targets, except for a few differences: 

<ul>
<li>FAKE_FLAGS is used instead of MAKE_FLAGS. By default,
FAKE_FLAGS sets DESTDIR=${WRKINST}.</li>

<li>FAKE_TARGET is used instead of INSTALL_TARGET.</li>

<li>The {pre,do,post}-install fragments are invoked with TRUEPREFIX
set to $(PREFIX), PREFIX set to $(WRKINST)$(PREFIX), and DESTDIR
set to $(WRKINST).</li>
</ul>

Ports using imake should work as is, since the imake fragments are
configured to use DESTDIR. Similarly, recent gnu-configure ports
should need no change.

<br><br>

Another good technique is a `late binding' trick: configure the
ports to use a prefix of $(DESTDIR)/usr/local, so that the
resulting Makefile has 

<pre>
prefix=$(DESTDIR)/usr/local
</pre>

set. When the port gets built, since DESTDIR is set to nothing,
/usr/local is used. And the fake install will put everything into
WRKINST/usr/local (e.g., for gnu configure, use 
<code>CONFIGURE_ARGS=--prefix='$$(DESTDIR)$(PREFIX)'</code>) <br>
<br>
 

<h4>Pitfalls</h4>

<ul>
<li>Some ports are inconsistent in their DESTDIR processing: most
of the port is happy with DESTDIR set, except for one or two
offenders. Patch the problem away.</li>

<li>Be careful to distinguish between the actual location where the
port is installed, and the location recorded in the configuration
files of the package. This is very easy to overlook, but easy to
fix using TRUEPREFIX.</li>

<li>Absolute symlinks always need to be tweaked. Luckily, 
<code>bsd.port.mk</code> will notice problems in that area.</li>

<li>A few ports don't want to leave $(DESTDIR) alone at the
configure stage. A post-configure fragment that tweaks all
Makefiles to add the DESTDIR is needed.</li>

<li>Very seldom, a port will resist all reasonable attempts to use
FAKE. A brute force approach should work: use pre-fake to link or
copy everything the port wants to find in the WRKINST area, then
perform the install under chroot.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Flavors</h3>

Options have been rationalized as flavors, so that package building
can be consistent. A port with options should set FLAVORS to the
list of all options that make sense for that port (e.g.,
FLAVORS=foo bar zoinx), then use FLAVOR to test what options have
actually been selected (e.g., FLAVOR=zoinx foo). <code>
bsd.port.mk</code> provides some support: 

<ul>
<li>The PKGNAME is tweaked to include dash separated options (e.g.,
package-foo-zoinx).</li>

<li>The WRKDIR is tweaked so that distinct flavors can be built
concurrently without colliding.</li>

<li>If the packing list is named PLIST.sed, constructs of the form
%%flavor%% will trigger the inclusion of PFRAG.flavor. The
%%SHARED%% construct triggers the inclusion of PFRAG.shared.</li>

<li>bsd.port.subdir.mk understands the extension
SUBDIR=directory:opt1,opt2 to say `build port in directory with
FLAVOR=opt1 opt2.'</li>
</ul>

Checking that a given flavor has been selected is as simple as: 

<pre>
.if ${FLAVOR:L}="zoinx foo"
</pre>

<br><br>

Checking that a flavor holds a given option is slightly more
tricky: 

<pre>
.if ${FLAVOR:L:Mzoinx}
</pre>
