<h2>OpenBSD/i386</h2>

<hr>
<h3><strong>History and Status:</strong></h3>

<p>
The i386 port has quite a few architecture specific changes from the
NetBSD/i386 port, but the major ones are:
<ul>
<li>Also runs on machines with 512MB of ram or more, does not crash.
<li>the addition of ISA bounce buffer support so that ISA scsi cards (ie.
	Adaptec 1542) can be used in machines with more than 16MB of memory.
<li>The same one GENERIC kernel works on all machines, whether it has
	BusLogic or Adaptec scsi cards.
<li>some APM and PCMCIA support (3c589, NE2000-clone, and COM ports)
<li>some DDB improvements
<li>OPTI mcd support
<li>ATAPI cdrom support
<li>P5/P6 improved NTP support
<li>pccons has userland replaceable keymaps, and screen blanking
<li>boot "-a" support like other ports (asks for root partition)
<li>floppy disk formatting
<li>Cyclades Cyclom serial driver
<li>faster (assembly) IP checksumming (typically 20% faster, up to 62% faster
	in some cases)
<li>vmstat -i prints interrupt information.
<li>latest rev of adaptec 2940 driver from FreeBSD
<li>supports "ep* at port ? irq ?"
<li>faster i386-specific `pccom' device driver.
<li>/dev/pctr pseudo-device & program for accessing the Pentium and PentiumPro
	performance counters.
<li>Fixed major i386 kernel interrupt race.
<li>Fixed UCONSOLE security hole without breaking xconsole.
<li>Much faster i387-specific libm available for those who want the option.
<li>ISA Plug-and-Play support
<li>the GPL FP emulator from Linux/Freebsd, for users who want to use it.
	Much better!
<li>Prefer partition type 166, so that OpenBSD can co-reside on the same
	disk as a 386BSD/NetBSD/FreeBSD install.
<li>Attempt to fault in a ptp; this avoids two ptp panic cases.
<li>RAW_PART is now 'c', not 'd'. It should start at 0, and cover your whole
	disk.
<li>Updated ncr driver, much more performance.
<li>3c59x and 3c9xx cards work.
<li>Can mount DOS file systems with cluster size > 16KB.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Installation with Other Operating Systems:</strong>
<br>
The OpenBSD i386 port can be installed to share the system disks with
other operating systems such as MSDOS, Windows or Linux using the MSDOS
MBR/partition scheme and an optional boot selector.  Everyday operation is
trouble free, but setup requires care and Windows '95 installation is known
to be careless about pre-existing MBR/partition information.
See the Installation Notes for more details.
<p>
<strong>Supported Hardware:</strong>
<br>
The OpenBSD i386 port works across a broad range of standard PC's and clones,
with a wide variety of processors and I/O bus architecures.  It can be expected
to install and run with minimal diffculty on most current products.
The cases where problems may be encountered are typically older proprietary
PC's, Laptops or specialized server boxes that rely on a custom BIOS to paper
over implementation differences.
<p>
OpenBSD does not currently support multiple processors, but will run using
one processor on a multi-processor system board.
