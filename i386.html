<h2>OpenBSD/i386</h2>

<hr>
<h3><strong>History and Status:</strong></h3>

<p>
The i386 port has quite a few architecture specific changes from the
NetBSD/i386 port, but the major ones are:
<ul>
<li>Also runs on machines with 512MB of ram or more, does not crash.
<li>the addition of ISA bounce buffer support so that ISA scsi cards (ie.
	Adaptec 1542) can be used in machines with more than 16MB of memory.
<li>The same one GENERIC kernel works on all machines, whether it has
	BusLogic or Adaptec scsi cards.
<li>some APM and PCMCIA support (3c589, NE2000-clone, and COM ports)
<li>some DDB improvements
<li>OPTI mcd support
<li>ATAPI cdrom support
<li>P5/P6 improved NTP support
<li>pccons has userland replaceable keymaps, and screen blanking
<li>boot "-a" support like other ports (asks for root partition)
<li>floppy disk formatting
<li>Cyclades Cyclom serial driver
<li>faster (assembly) IP checksumming (typically 20% faster, up to 62% faster
	in some cases)
<li>vmstat -i prints interrupt information.
<li>latest rev of adaptec 2940 driver from FreeBSD
<li>supports "ep* at port ? irq ?"
<li>faster i386-specific `pccom' device driver.
<li>/dev/pctr pseudo-device & program for accessing the Pentium and PentiumPro
	performance counters.
<li>Fixed major i386 kernel interrupt race.
<li>Fixed UCONSOLE security hole without breaking xconsole.
<li>Much faster i387-specific libm available for those who want the option.
<li>ISA Plug-and-Play support
<li>the GPL FP emulator from Linux/Freebsd, for users who want to use it.
	Much better!
<li>Prefer partition type 166, so that OpenBSD can co-reside on the same
	disk as a 386BSD/NetBSD/FreeBSD install.
<li>Attempt to fault in a ptp; this avoids two ptp panic cases.
<li>RAW_PART is now 'c', not 'd'. It should start at 0, and cover your whole
	disk.
<li>Updated ncr driver, much more performance.
<li>3c59x and 3c9xx cards work.
<li>Can mount DOS file systems with cluster size > 16KB.
</ul>
