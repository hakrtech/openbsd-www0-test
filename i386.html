<h2>OpenBSD/i386</h2>

<hr>
<h3><strong>History and Status:</strong></h3>

<p>
The i386 port has quite a few architecture specific changes from the
NetBSD/i386 port, but the major ones are:
<ul>
<li>Also runs on machines with 512MB of ram or more, does not crash.
<li>the addition of ISA bounce buffer support so that ISA scsi cards (ie.
	Adaptec 1542) can be used in machines with more than 16MB of memory.
<li>The same one GENERIC kernel works on all machines, whether it has
	BusLogic or Adaptec scsi cards.
<li>some APM and PCMCIA support (3c589, NE2000-clone, and COM ports)
<li>some DDB improvements
<li>OPTI mcd support
<li>ATAPI cdrom support
<li>P5/P6 improved NTP support
<li>pccons has userland replaceable keymaps, and screen blanking
<li>boot "-a" support like other ports (asks for root partition)
<li>floppy disk formatting
<li>Cyclades Cyclom serial driver
<li>faster (assembly) IP checksumming (typically 20% faster, up to 62% faster
	in some cases)
<li>vmstat -i prints interrupt information.
<li>latest rev of adaptec 2940 driver from FreeBSD
<li>supports "ep* at port ? irq ?"
<li>faster i386-specific `pccom' device driver.
<li>/dev/pctr pseudo-device & program for accessing the Pentium and PentiumPro
	performance counters.
<li>Fixed major i386 kernel interrupt race.
<li>Fixed UCONSOLE security hole without breaking xconsole.
<li>Much faster i387-specific libm available for those who want the option.
<li>ISA Plug-and-Play support
<li>the GPL FP emulator from Linux/Freebsd, for users who want to use it.
	Much better!
<li>Prefer partition type 166, so that OpenBSD can co-reside on the same
	disk as a 386BSD/NetBSD/FreeBSD install.
<li>Attempt to fault in a ptp; this avoids two ptp panic cases.
<li>RAW_PART is now 'c', not 'd'. It should start at 0, and cover your whole
	disk.
<li>Updated ncr driver, much more performance.
<li>3c59x and 3c9xx cards work.
<li>Can mount DOS file systems with cluster size > 16KB.
</ul>

<p>
<h3>Installation with Other Operating Systems:</h3>
The OpenBSD i386 port can be installed to share the system disks with
other operating systems such as MSDOS, Windows or Linux using the MSDOS
MBR/partition scheme and an optional boot selector.  Everyday operation is
trouble free, but setup requires care and Windows '95 installation is known
to be careless about pre-existing MBR/partition information.
See the Installation Notes for more details.

<p>
<h3>Supported Hardware:</h3>
The OpenBSD i386 port works across a broad range of standard PC's and clones,
with a wide variety of processors and I/O bus architecures.  It can be expected
to install and run with minimal diffculty on most current products.
The cases where problems may be encountered are typically older proprietary
PC's, Laptops or specialized server boxes that rely on a custom BIOS to paper
over implementation differences.

<p>
OpenBSD does not currently support multiple processors, but will run using
one processor on a multi-processor system board.

<p>
<ul>
<li> All mainstream i386 architecture CPU chips, including 386, 486, Pentium, Pentium-Pro and compatibles such as the AMD K5 series.
<li> Basically all standard ISA, VLB, PCI, or PCMCIA bus based machines.
<li> Floppy controllers.
<li> MFM, ESDI, IDE, and RLL hard disk controllers.
<li> SCSI host adapters:
  <ul>
  <li> Adaptec AHA-154xA, -B, -C, and -CF
  <li> Adaptec AHA-174x
  <li> Adaptec AIC-6260 and AIC-6360 based boards, including the Adaptec AHA-152x and the SoundBlaster SCSI host adapter.  (Note that you cannot boot from these boards if they do not have a boot ROM; only the AHA-152x and motherboards using this chip are likely to be bootable, consequently.)
  <li> Adaptec AIC-7770-based SCSI host adapters (including the Adaptec AHA-274x, AHA-284x families).
  <li> Adaptec AHA-294x[W] cards and some onboard PCI designs using the AIC7870 chip.  This driver does *not* currently work with non-PCI AIC-7xxx boards or the Adaptec 3940.
  <li> Buslogic 54x (Adaptec AHA-154x clones; driver on kcadp floppy)
  <li> BusLogic 445, 74x, 9xx  (But not the new "FlashPoint" series of BusLogic SCSI adapters)
  <li> Symbios Logic (NCR) 53C8xx-based PCI SCSI host adapters
  <li> Ultrastor 14f, 34f, and (possibly) 24f
  <li> Seagate/Future Domain ISA SCSI adapter cards, including
    <ul>
    <li> ST01/02
    <li> Future Domain TMC-885
    <li> Future Domain TMC-950
    </ul>
  </ul>
 
<li> MDA, CGA, VGA, SVGA, and HGC Display Adapters.  (Note that not all of the display adapters OpenBSD/i386 can work with are supported by X.  See the XFree86 FAQ for more information.)

Drivers for hardware marked with "[*]" are NOT included on the
distribution floppies.  Except as noted above, all other drivers are
present on both kernel-copy disks.  Also, at the present time, the
distributed kernels support only one SCSI host adapter per machine.
OpenBSD normally allows more, though, so if you have more than one, you
can use all of them by compiling a custom kernel once OpenBSD is
installed.
 
Support for devices marked with "[+]" IS included in the "generic" kernels,
although it is not in the kernel on the installation floppy.

<h3>Unsupported Hardware</h3>
<ul>
<li> "Micro Channel" MCA bus used in many IBM PS/2 models.
<li> APM power management -- if your system supports it, turn it off!
<li> NCR 5380-based SCSI host adapters.
<li> QIC-40 and QIC-80 tape drives.  (Those are the tape drives that connect to the floppy disk controller.)
<li> WD-7000 SCSI host adapters.
<li> PCI-PCI bridges and cards which include them, such as the AHA-394x SCSI host adapter and some DC21x4x-based multi-Ethernet cards.
<li> Multiprocessor Pentium and Pentium Pro systems.  (Though they should run fine using one processor only.)
<li> Intel EtherExpress 100 Fast Ethernet adapters. (can be merged in soon)
</ul>
