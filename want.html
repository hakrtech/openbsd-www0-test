<h2><font color=#e00000>Hardware wanted</font><hr></h2>

<h3><font color=#e00000>Why do we want your old hardware?</font></h3>
<p>
The following list outlines hardware that the OpenBSD project could use.
Some of this is being requested so that developers can improve or add driver
support for devices which are rare; other requests are for hardware that
will improve our development environment.  In either case, we think we are
being reasonable at asking for these devices.<p>

If you do not own these devices, but want to help us, we recommend you
search on <a href=http://www.ebay.com>eBay</a> for the devices.  If
you do the bidding and then get the device shipped to us, it really
helps us.  It's much better if our developers do not need to spend the
time going through the bidding process, since any time saved can be
spend on improving OpenBSD instead.

<h3><font color=#e00000>Additional Notes</font></h3>
<p>
Notes:
<dl>
<li>In each case, please contact
<a href=mailto:deraadt@openbsd.org>Theo de Raadt</a>
before simply shipping hardware around.  (So that we can decide where
the hardware needs to be shipped to).<p>
<li>As an extra incentive, Theo is willing to trade quantities of stickers
for some of these things.<p>
<li>When shipping over International borders, never use UPS regular service,
because they charge incredible fees for brokerage.<p>
