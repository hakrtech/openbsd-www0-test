<h2><font color=#e00000>Hardware wanted</font><hr></h2>

<h3><font color=#e00000>Why do we want your old hardware?</font></h3>
<p>
The following list outlines hardware that the OpenBSD project could use.
Some of this is being requested so that developers can improve or add driver
support for devices which are rare; other requests are for hardware that
will improve our development environment.  In either case, we think we are
being reasonable at asking for these devices.<p>

If you do not own these devices, but want to help us, we recommend you
search on <a href=http://www.ebay.com>eBay</a> for the devices.  If
you do the bidding and then get the device shipped to us, it really
helps us.  It's much better if our developers do not need to spend the
time going through the bidding process, since any time saved can be
spend on improving OpenBSD instead.<p>

As a reasonably large quantity of OpenBSD developers and users are in northern
Europe we have setup a specific want list for that area.  If you are in that
region, go <a href=#n-eur>here</a> first to check what developers close
to you are in need of or want to work on support for.

<h3><font color=#e00000>Additional Notes</font></h3>
<p>
Notes:
<dl>
<li>In each case, please contact
<a href=mailto:deraadt@openbsd.org>Theo de Raadt</a>
before simply shipping hardware around.  (So that we can decide where
the hardware needs to be shipped to).<p>
<li>As an extra incentive, Theo is willing to trade quantities of stickers
for some of these things.<p>
<li>When shipping over International borders, never use UPS regular service,
because they charge incredible fees for brokerage.<p>
