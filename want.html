<h2>Hardware wanted.</h2>

<p>
The following list outlines hardware that the OpenBSD project could use.
Some of this is being requested so that developers can improve or add driver
support for devices which are rare; other requests are for hardware that
will improve our development environment.  In either case, we think we are
being reasonable at asking for these devices.


<p>
In each case, please contact
<a href=mailto:deraadt@openbsd.org>Theo de Raadt</a>
before simply shipping hardware around.  (So that we can decide where
the hardware needs to be shipped to).

<p>
ps. as an extra incentive, Theo is willing to trade quantities of stickers
for some of these things...

<ul> 
<li>Alpha hardware:
    <ul>
    <li>Some alpha hardware in Europe and North America.
    <li>We are especially looking for alphas better than the
	Multia and axppci33 models.
    <li>If we do not get some of these, we are not going to
	ship OpenBSD/alpha on the 2.5 CDROM (it isn't worth our effort).
    </ul>
<p>
<li>A Pentium-2/450 motherboard.
<p>

	for RAIDframe testing.
    <li>NetGear GA620 gigabit ethernet card, or other Alteon-based board.
    <li>AdvanSys 3940U2W SCSI cards (preferably two: one for PC and one for
	Mac development).
    <li>S3 SonicVibes PCI audio card.
    </ul>
<p>
<li>Infrastructure requirements:
    <ul>
    <li>A fast/wide differential scsi drive and cable
    <li>A small 1000mbit etherswitch, for gigabit network development.
    <li>a fairly large UPS (Calgary)
    <li>a medium sized UPS for the OpenBSD mail and lists machine (Boulder Colorado)
    </ul>
<p>
<li>Amiga 68060 card, fit for an A2000 or A3000, preferably with fast scsi
	and slots for cheap memory.
