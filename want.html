<h2>Hardware wanted.</h2>

<p>
The following list outlines hardware that the OpenBSD project could use.
Some of this is being requested so that developers can improve or add driver
support for devices which are rare; other requests are for hardware that
will improve our development environment.  In either case, we think we are
being reasonable at asking for these devices.


<p>
In each case, please contact
<a href=mailto:deraadt@openbsd.org>Theo de Raadt</a>
before simply shipping hardware around.  (So that we can decide where
the hardware needs to be shipped to).

<p>
ps. as an extra incentive, Theo is willing to trade quantities of stickers
for some of these things...

<ul> 
<li>Alpha hardware:
    <ul>
    <li>Some alpha hardware in Europe and North America.
    <li>We are especially looking for alphas better than the
	Multia and axppci33 models.
    <li>If we do not get some of these, we are not going to
	ship OpenBSD/alpha on the 2.5 CDROM (it isn't worth our effort).
