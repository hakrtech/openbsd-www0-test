<h2><font color="#e00000">版權採用方針</font></h2>
<hr>

<ul>
<li><h3><font color="#e00000">目標</font></h3><p>

著作權(版權)法是複雜的, OpenBSD 有個簡單的方針 - OpenBSD 盡全力保有
原本 Berkeley Unix 的版權宣告.
<p>

OpenBSD 能夠有今日的成長, 是因為 Berkeley 的 Computer Systems Research
Group 所立下的榜樣, 另外他們與其他人的努力, 才創造出並保有較無法律問題
的原始碼散布模式.
<p>

可以 <strong>自由地再散布</strong> 的能力. "Berkeley" Unix 的進展, 已經達
到可與許多其他作業系統發展團隊交換原始程式碼的程度了, 不管是內部或是跨團隊
的交換皆然.
瞭解有關著作權法的相關考量後, 才能交換並且再散布原始程式碼, 並且仍保有原版
權宣告的精神, 其握有散布程式碼權力的觀念, 也是促使參與其中的人們協力合作的
基石.
<p>

<li><h3><font color="#e00000"> Berkeley 版權宣告</font></h3><p>

Berkeley 版權宣告對於軟體的私人或商業使用並無任何限制, 並且僅要求一個簡單
且一致的條件: 對於任何再散布的版本中, 必須保有原本的版權宣告, 及著明原作者的
姓名列表, <strong>純粹只有</strong>宣傳的意涵.
<p>
以下是典型的範例:
<p>

<p>
(注意: 在系統中, 有些部份的第三, 第四點版權宣告甚至也移除了, 讓再散布的動作更
為容易)
<p>
因為 OpenBSD 的版權宣告僅止於 Berkeley 版權宣告, OpenBSD 希望可以達到與
Berkeley 同樣程度的廣泛散布與應用. 也因為這點, OpenBSD 不能包含有比 Berkeley
版權宣告更嚴苛的程式碼, 也不能包含更改該著作為另一種版權狀態的版權宣告, 也就
是指 OpenBSD 整體是可以自由免費的再散布的, 但是其中部份元件可能無法單獨自由
免費的再散布.
<p>

<li><h3><font color="#e00000">著作權法</font></h3><p>
雖然完整的著作權法已經超過本文的範圍, 一些基本的道理仍是相通的. 依據現行的
法律, 著作權除非是有另行宣告, 否則皆是隨著創作物被產生之時就隨原創者擁有的, 
一般來說, 版權僅可及於基本創作本身, 而不能延伸到基於基本創作所衍生的創作物,
也不包含衍生創作物中的基本創作物.
<p>

著作權法包函以下三種的創作物:
<dl>
<dt>原創創作物
<dd>非基於現有創作物衍生的原創創作物
<dt>衍生創作物
<dd>該創作物是衍生於, 包函, 或修改現有創作物
<dt>編輯創作物
<dd>該創作物是編輯現有或衍生創作物而成
</dl>
<p>

The fundamental concept is that there is primacy of the copyright, that
is a copyright of a derivative work does not affect the rights held by
the owner of the copyright of the original work, rather only the part
added.  Likewise the copyright of a compilation does not affect the rights
of the owner of the included works, only the compilation as an entity.
<p>

It is vitally important to understand that copyrights are broad protections
as defined by national and international copyright law.  The "copyright
notices" usually included in source files are not copyrights, but rather
notices that a party asserts that they hold copyright to the material or
to part of the material.  Typically these notices are associated with
license terms which grant permissions subject to copyright law and with
disclaimers that state the position of the copyright holder/distributor
with respect to liability surrounding use of the material.
<p>

<li><h3><font color="#e00000">使用許可 - 相對於版權的另一面</font></h3><p>

Because copyrights arise from the creation of a work, rather than through
a registration process, there needs to be a practical way to extend
permission to use a work beyond what might be allowed by "fair use"
provisions of the copyright laws.
<p>

This permission typically takes the form of a "release" or "license"
included in the work, which grants the additional uses beyond those
granted by copyright law, usually subject to a variety of conditions.
At one extreme sits "public domain" where the originator asserts that
he imposes no restrictions on  use of the material, at the other
restrictive clauses that actually grant no additional rights or impose
restrictive, discriminatory or impractical conditions on use of the work.
<p>

Again, an important point to note is that the release and conditions can
only apply to the portion of the work that was originated by the copyright
holder - the holder of a copyright on a derivative work can neither
grant additional permissions for use of the original work, nor impose more
restrictive conditions for use of that work.
<p>

Because copyright arises from the creation of a work and not the text
or a registration process, removing or altering a copyright notice or
associated release terms has no bearing on the existence of the copyright,
rather all that is accomplished to whatever rights the person making the
modifications had to use the material in the first place.  Likewise, adding
terms and conditions in conflict with the original terms and conditions
does not supersede them, rather it casts doubts on the rights of the person
making the amendments to use the material and creates confusion as to
whether anyone can use amended version or derivatives thereof.
<p>

Finally, releases are generally binding on the material that they
are distributed with.  This means that if the originator of a work distributes
that work with a release granting certain permissions, those permissions
apply as stated, without discrimination, to all persons legitimately
possessing a copy of the work.  That means that having granted a permission,
the copyright holder can not retroactively say that an individual or class
of individuals are no longer granted those permissions.  Likewise should
the copyright holder decide to "go commercial" he can not revoke permissions
already granted for the use of the work as distributed, though he may impose
more restrictive permissions in his future distributions of that work.
<p>

<li><h3><font color="#e00000">特殊案例</font></h3><p>

This section attempts to summarize the position of OpenBSD relative to
some commonly encountered copyrights.
<p>

<dl>
<dt>Berkeley<dd><p>
The Berkeley copyright is the model for the OpenBSD copyright.  It retains
the rights of the copyright holder, while imposing minimal conditions on
the use of the copyrighted material.  Material with Berkeley copyrights,
or copyrights closely adhering to the Berkeley model can generally be
included in OpenBSD.
<p>

<dt>AT&amp;T<dd><p>
While AT&amp;T holds the copyrights to much "Unix" code and documentation,
OpenBSD is based largely on Berkeley (BSD) distributions that contain only
material known to be free of AT&amp;T copyrights, or material to which
AT&amp;T has abandoned its copyright or included licensing terms similar
to the Berkeley terms.  No material subject to restrictive AT&amp;T
copyrights can be included in OpenBSD.
<p>

Examples of AT&amp;T code, included subject to non-restrictive copyrights,
include some system sources such as init_main.c and the AT&amp;T version
of awk.
<p>

<dt>DEC, Sun, other manufacturers/software houses.<dd><p>
In general OpenBSD does not include material copyrighted by manufacturers
or software houses.  Material may be included where the copyright owner has
granted general permission for reuse without conditions, with terms similar
to the Berkeley copyright, or where the material is the product of an
employee and the employer's copyright notice effectively releases any
rights they might have to the work.
<p>

<dt>Carnegie-Mellon (CMU, Mach)<dd><p>
The Carnegie-Mellon copyright is similar to the Berkeley copyright, except
that it requests that derivative works be made available to Carnegie-Mellon.
Because this is only a request and not a condition, such material can still
be included in OpenBSD.  It should be noted that existing versions of Mach
are still subject to AT&amp;T copyrights, which prevents the general
distribution of Mach sources.
<p>

<dt>Apache<dd><p>
The Apache copyright is similar to the Berkeley copyright, except
that it stipulates that products derived from the code may not
have "Apache" in their name.  The purpose of this clause is to
avoid a situation in which another party releases a modified version
of the code named in such a way to make users think that it is the
"official" version.  This is not an issue with OpenBSD because
OpenBSD is a <strong>Compilation</strong>, and not a
<strong>Derived Work</strong>.
<p>

<dt>GNU General Public License, GPL, LGPL, copyleft, etc.<dd><p>
The GNU Public License and licenses modeled on it impose the restriction
that source code must be distributed or made available for all works that
are derivatives of the GNU copyrighted code.
<p>

While this may be a noble strategy in terms of software sharing, it is a
condition that is typically unacceptable for commercial use of software.
As a consequence, software bound by the GPL terms can not be included in
the kernel or "runtime" of OpenBSD, though software subject to GPL terms
may be included as development tools or as part of the system that are
"optional" as long as such use does not result in OpenBSD as a whole
becoming subject to the GPL terms.
<p>

As an example, some ports include GNU Floating Point Emulation - this is
optional and the system can be built without it or with an alternative
emulation package.  Another example is the use of GCC and other GNU tools in
the OpenBSD tool chain - it is quite possible to distribute a system for
many applications without a tool chain, or the distributor can choose to
include a tool chain as an optional bundle which conforms to the GPL terms.
<p>

<dt>NetBSD<dd><p>
Much of OpenBSD is originally based on and evolved from NetBSD, since some
of the OpenBSD developers were involved in the NetBSD project.  The general
NetBSD license terms are compatible with the Berkeley license and permit
such use.  Material subject <strong>only</strong> to the general NetBSD
license can generally be included in OpenBSD.
<p>

In the past, NetBSD has included material copyrighted by individuals
who have imposed license conditions beyond that of the general
NetBSD license, but granted the NetBSD Foundation license to
distribute the material.  Such material can not be included in
OpenBSD as long as the conditions imposed are at odds with the
OpenBSD license terms or releases from those terms are offered on
a discriminatory basis.
<p>

<dt>FreeBSD<dd><p>
Most of FreeBSD is also based on Berkeley licensed material or includes
copyright notices based on the Berkeley model.  Such material can be
included in OpenBSD, while those parts that are subject to GPL or
various individual copyright terms that are at odds with the OpenBSD license
can not be included in OpenBSD.
<p>

<dt>Linux<dd><p>
Most of Linux is subject to GPL style licensing terms and therefore
can not be included in OpenBSD.  Individual components may be eligible,
subject to the terms of the originator's copyright notices.  Note that
Linux "distributions" may also be subject to additional copyright claims
of the distributing organization, either as a compilation or on material
included that is not part of the Linux core.
<p>

<dt>X, XFree86<dd><p>
X and XFree86 are not parts of OpenBSD, rather X or XFree86 is distributed
with many OpenBSD ports as a convenience to the user, subject to applicable
license terms.
<p>

<dt>Shareware, Charityware, Freeware, etc.<dd><p>
Most "shareware" copyright notices impose conditions for redistribution,
use or visibility that are at conflict with the OpenBSD project goals.
Review on a case-by-case basis is required as to whether the wording
of the conditions is acceptable in terms of conditions being requested vs.
demanded and whether the spirit of the conditions is compatible with
goals of the OpenBSD project.
<p>

<dt>Public Domain<dd><p>
While material that is truly entered into the "Public Domain" can be
included in OpenBSD, review is required on a case by case basis.
Frequently the "public domain" assertion is made by someone who does
not really hold all rights under Copyright law to grant that status or
there are a variety of conditions imposed on use.   For a work to be
truly in the "Public Domain" all rights are abandoned and the material
is offered without restrictions.
