<h3><font color="#0000e0"><a name=cdrom>CDROM</a></font></h3>

<p>
The best way to get an OpenBSD release (<i>-release</i>) and support us
is to buy a 3-CD set. More information is available on our
<a href="orders.html">ordering page</a>.

<p>
If you choose not to buy an OpenBSD CD-ROM, you can also install
OpenBSD with a CDROM you burn yourself. To achieve this, you have to
download an ISO (i.e. <i>install42.iso</i> for <i>4.2</i>) for the
architecture you are running, from one of our
<a href="ftp.html">mirrors</a>. ISOs are roughly 200MB in size, and you 
will not need anything else but the <a href="faq/faq15.html">application
packages</a>.

<p>
Note that the paragraph above is also valid for the people interested by
running <i>-current</i>. You can fetch <i>install42.iso</i> from the
latest snapshot and install or upgrade your system very quickly.

<h3><font color="#0000e0"><a name=mirrors>FTP/HTTP/AFS/RSYNC
  Mirrors</a></font></h3>

<p>
OpenBSD can be also easily installed via FTP. Typically you need a
single small piece of boot media (e.g., a boot floppy) and then the rest
of the files can be installed from a number of locations, including
directly off the Internet. Follow this simple set of instructions to
ensure that you find all of the documentation you will need while
performing an install via FTP. With the CD-ROMs, the necessary
documentation is easier to find.

<h3>1 - Choose a mirror</h3>

<p>
Read either of the following two files for a list of ftp mirrors which
provide OpenBSD, then choose one near you:

<ul>
	<li><a href="ftp.html">http://www.OpenBSD.org/ftp.html</a></li>
	<li><a href="ftp://ftp.OpenBSD.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.2/ftplist"
	  >ftp://ftp.OpenBSD.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.2/ftplist</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>2 - Connect to the mirror</h3>

<p>
Connect to that ftp mirror site and go into the directory
pub/OpenBSD/4.2/ which contains these files and directories. This is a
list of what you should see:

<pre>
        ANNOUNCEMENT    amd64/          mac68k/         sparc64/
        Changelogs/     armish/         macppc/         src.tar.gz
        HARDWARE        avioon/         mvme68k/        sys.tar.gz
        PACKAGES        ftplist         mvme88k/        tools/
        PORTS           hp300/          packages/       vax/
        README          hppa/           ports.tar.gz    zaurus/
        SIZES           i386/           root.mail
        XF4.tar.gz      landisk/        sgi/
        alpha/          luna88k/        sparc/
</pre>

<p>
It is quite likely that you will want AT LEAST the following files which
apply to all the architectures OpenBSD supports. 

<pre>
        README          - generic README
        HARDWARE        - list of hardware we support
        PORTS           - description of our "ports" tree
        PACKAGES        - description of pre-compiled packages
        root.mail       - a copy of root's mail at initial login.
                          (This is really worthwhile reading).
</pre>

<p>
Read the <i>README</i> file. It is short, and a quick read will make
sure you understand what else you need to fetch.

<h3>3 - Choose the installation methods</h3>

<p>
Next, go into the directory that applies to your architecture, for
example, <i>i386</i>. You should see something similar to the
following:

<pre>
        INSTALL.i386    cd42.iso        floppyB42.fs    pxeboot*
        INSTALL.linux   cdboot*         floppyC42.fs    xbase42.tgz
        MD5             cdbr*           game42.tgz      xetc42.tgz
        base42.tgz      cdemu42.iso     index.txt       xfont42.tgz
        bsd*            comp42.tgz      install42.iso   xserv42.tgz
        bsd.mp*         etc42.tgz       man42.tgz       xshare42.tgz
        bsd.rd*         floppy42.fs     misc42.tgz
</pre>

<p>
Many ways to perform a new installation are available on our mirrors and
you will have to choose one of the following methods:

<ul>
	<li>CDROM -- use the install42.iso files and burn a CDR</li>
	<li>Floppy -- write the floppy*42.iso files to a floppy</li>
	<li>Network protocols (<i>PXE</i>, <i>MOP</i>, etc.)</li>
	<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Consult the <a href="faq/faq4.html">Installation Guide</a> to get an
exhaustive list of the different ways to install OpenBSD, and learn how
to make a bootable OpenBSD install media.
