<h3><strong>History and Status:</strong></h3>

<p>
This port was primarily done by Theo de Raadt in 1995 as a contract to
Willowglen Singapore.  An earlier port to the MVME147 by Chuck Cranor
based on Paul Mackerras' old DA30 code (and using hardware donated by
Jonathan Levine at Theo's request) provided a solid development
platform.  Bizzarely, Dale Rahn of Motorola also independently wrote a
port to the MVME147.  For most kernel parts, both their ports were
analysed but more code was written new by Theo, or based on the hp300
code.  Dale helped significantly during the porting to the 68040
models and wrote most of the code specific to the MVME167 model.
Steve Murphee continued work and made the MVME177 work, as well as
adding support for some VME devices.

<p>
The people working the most on OpenBSD/mvme68k currently consists of
Steve Murphee, Theo de Raadt, and Dale Rahn. Of course, others are
very welcome!

<p>
The same kernel currently runs on the following pieces of hardware:

<ul>
<li><strong>MVME147: </strong>68030<br>
This works stably.
<ul>
<li>Everything supported except the parallel port.
<li>I have a driver for the parallel port, but it is not integrated yet.
</ul>
<p>

<li><strong>MVME162: </strong>68040<br>
This works stably.
<ul>
<li>Everything important working.. with these additional notes:
<li>SCSI working (4.5MB/sec off a 4.2G Quantum Grand Prix).<br>
<li>VME bus support untested
<li>parity and ecc not supported
<li>flash driver not working
<li>IP module driver untested
</ul>
<p>

<li><strong>MVME165: </strong>68040<br>
What little we know about it makes us think it is doable.
<p>

<li><strong>MVME166: </strong>68040<br>
This might already work. Anyone want to test it?
<p>

<li><strong>MVME167C: </strong>68040<br>
This works stably.
<ul>
<li>Works as well as the MVME162 port above, plus these notes:
<li>parallel port not supported.
</ul>


<li><strong>MVME177-001: </strong>68060<br>
This works stably.
<ul>
<li>Works as well as the MVME167 port.
</ul>
<p>

</ul>

Additional VME devices that are supported:<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MVME376</strong>: VME Lance ethernet
<li><strong>MVME328</strong>: SCSI controller
</ul> 

<p>
For all these architectures, both diskless booting using sun-style
bootparams/nfs and regular full disk booting are supported.

<p>
Note: This port has COMPAT_SUNOS support, so it can run SunOS sun3
binaries. As such, I think that the MVME177 is probably the fastest
machine capable of running SunOS sun3 binaries....
