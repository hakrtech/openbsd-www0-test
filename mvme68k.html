<h2>OpenBSD/mvme68k</h2>

<hr>
<h3><strong>History and Status:</strong></h3>

<p>
This port was primarily done by Theo de Raadt as a contract to
Willowglen Singapore.  An earlier port to the MVME147 by Chuck Cranor
based on Paul Mackerras' old DA30 code (and using hardware donated by
Jonathan Levine at Theo's request) provided a solid development
platform.  Bizzarely, Dale Rahn of Motorola also independently wrote a
port to the MVME147.  Both their ports have since been superceded by
new code written by Theo based on the hp300 code.  Dale helped
significantly during the porting to the 68040 models and wrote most of
the code specific to the MVME167 model.
</p>

<p>
The people working the most on OpenBSD/mvme68k currently consists of
Theo de Raadt, Chuck Cranor, and Dale Rahn. Of course, others are
very welcome!
</p>

<p>
The cards look a little like <a href=nitro60.html>this</a>. (a picture
of a real MVME16x card would be nice, please mail
<a href=mailto:deraadt@openbsd.org>deraadt@openbsd.org</a>
if you find one.)
</p>

<p>
The same kernel will (hopefully) eventually run on all
of the following:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.motorola.com/GSS/MCG/support/hard/147-2012.html">MVME147</a>
(68030): this works stably
<li>parallel port not supported.

<br>
<a href="http://www.motorola.com/GSS/MCG/support/hard/162-2013.html">MVME162</a>
(68040): this works stably
<li>SCSI working (4.5MB/sec off a 4.2G Quantum Grand Prix).<br>
<li>VME possibly not working
<li>parity and ecc not supported.
<li>flash driver not working
<li>IP module driver untested

<br>
<a href="http://www.motorola.com/GSS/MCG/support/hard/165-2047.html">MVME165</a>
(68040): what little I know about it makes me think it doable.

<br>
<a href="http://www.motorola.com/GSS/MCG/support/hard/166-2048.html">MVME166</a>
(68040): this might already work. anyone want to test it?

<br>
<a href="http://www.motorola.com/GSS/MCG/support/hard/167-2014.html">MVME167</a>
(68040): this works stably.
<li>SCSI working fine
<li>VME possibly not working
<li>parity and ecc not supported.
<li>parallel port not supported.

<br>
MVME177
(68060): Dale appears to be slowly working on this.
</p>


<p>
Motorola makes a few older 68020/68851 models which could perhaps also be
supported. As well, I've noticed that Heurikon 68040/68060 cards have
similar scsi/ethernet/serial/vme chips.
</p>

<p>
For all these ports, diskless booting using sun-style bootparams/nfs
works fine.
</p>

<p>
Note: This port has COMPAT_SUNOS support, so it can run SunOS sun3
binaries. As such, I think this is probably the fastest machine
capable of running SunOS sun3 binaries....
