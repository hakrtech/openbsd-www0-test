<h2>OpenBSD/sparc64</h2>

<hr>

<p>
OpenBSD/sparc64 runs on the 64bit Sun UltraSPARC machines.
The current port maintainer is Jason Wright
(<a href="mailto:jason@openbsd.org">jason@openbsd.org</a>).
Others are welcome to contribute.
</p>
<h3><font color="#0000e0"><strong>History:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
The orginal port was made for NetBSD by Eduardo Horvath and released for
the first time in January 1999.
The porting to OpenBSD started in August 2001 and in the end of September the
first binary snapshot was released. The porting was done mainly by Jason
Wright and Artur Grabowski and was done on both sbus and PCI machines so that
a decently wide range of hardware support was ready even before the system
could boot multiuser.
</p>

<h3><font color="#0000e0"><strong>Current status:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
Currently most of the hardware available to the developers boots multiuser and
supports enough of the on-board devices to be generally useable. No attempts
have been made for graphics console support yet, so only serial or prom
consoles are available. The same applies to support of more expansion hardware
for the PCI bus or the SBUS.

<p>
There hasn't yet been a need for a separate mailing list for OpenBSD/sparc64,
so the OpenBSD/sparc mailing list is being used.  To join the OpenBSD/sparc
mailing list, send a message with a body of "<b>subscribe sparc</b>" to <a
href="mailto:majordomo@OpenBSD.org">majordomo@OpenBSD.org</a>.
